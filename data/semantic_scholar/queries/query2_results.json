    "abstract": "Predictive modeling is important in analyzing graduates’ job outcomes, especially in forecasting job placements based on academic performance and courses. This study aims to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability in job placement classification using advanced machine learning models and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Utilizing a dataset containing graduates’ academic records, including course grades, grade point average (GPA), and internship duration, this research employed several classification models, including decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), CatBoost, and logistic regression. Evaluation metrics showed that most models achieve 92% precision, 92% recall, and 92% F1 score, with an accuracy of 85%, while logistic regression excelled with 100% recall, 96% F1 score, and 92% accuracy. SHAP analysis identified key features such as Administration, Computer Organization, Information Systems, Entrepreneurship, Professional Ethics, and Web Programming as the most influential in predicting job placement. Other significant contributors include Introduction to Information Technology, Software Engineering II, and Data Mining, although with relatively lower influence. Extracurricular activities and internship experiences were also found to be influential factors, highlighting the importance of academic and nonacademic elements in shaping graduates’ career prospects. These findings highlight and emphasize the need to provide students with certain academic courses to better prepare them for the job market. These findings emphasize the importance of interpretable machine learning models in career forecasting, enabling educational institutions to optimize curriculum design and enhance graduates’ employability. Future research should explore feature selection techniques, temporal analysis, and personalized recommendation systems to refine predictive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Designing and delivering web application courses for computing undergraduates is a challenging task. Lack of understanding of web concepts affects the students” interest in web application development. Therefore., faculty employ several traditional strategies including hands on exercises and labs as well as innovative strategies such as videos and discussion forums. However., due to the volume of the posts in the forums., the instructors find it challenging to attend to the students' challenges and focus on more challenging topics across the classroom. In this paper., we propose a text mining based solution to extract the questions and complex topics. We evaluated the solution on the year 2 Web Application course offered to the computing undergraduates. Our experiments show that logistic regression model performs better in classifying question posts and cosine similarity performs better in assigning the topic label to the posts. The findings are visually depicted and are useful to the faculty to identify the topics that requires more attention to improve students' learning.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes and researches deeply the main problems existing in the teaching process of Web front-end courses based on the Internet mode.It also puts forward the theory knowledge system of Web 3.0 front-end course and the core idea of creating progressive online project case, thus changing the students' traditional learning methods and making the students change from theoretical memorizing learning to practical learning.And gradually reform the computer room offline teaching mode and examination mode, ensure that students master the latest related theories, technologies and tools of Web front-end courses as soon as possible, so that students can adapt to the needs of enterprises for Web front-end talents. 1. A Review of domestic and Foreign Research status 1.1 Relevant research on the theoretical knowledge system of Web front-end courses. In recent years, based on Internet + mode, around the Web front-end curriculum theory knowledge system reform and exploration of related research, from the current knowledge of literature, mainly focus on the teaching content, teaching mode and study on the corresponding talent training, etc.Such as The teaching reform and practice of Web front-end development technology course by Jiuliang Chu. Computer education,2014(14); Liqing Zeng’s Research on the front-end development framework of web application for web 2.0.Technology and innovation,2015(22) ; Research on the exploration and talent cultivation of Web front-end technology course content by Song Yang. information and computer (theory), 2016(11); Reflection on WEB programming course teaching by Liu Ni. Journal of guiyang college (natural science edition),2017(04) and other Scholars discuss the importance and necessity of the reform of the theoretical knowledge system of Web front-end courses from different perspectives. 1.2 Related research on project case teaching. Case teaching as a kind of teaching mode is widely applied in the system of higher education, especially those who have strong course requires students to practice is especially important in the teaching, at present scholars mainly focus on aspects such as case teaching, case selection and evaluation system for related research.Such as Jinghua Sun’s Application of case teaching method in Web programming teaching. Chinese science and technology information,2008(20);The practice and exploration of the reform of college classroom teaching mode by case teaching by Huarong Wang. Chinese university teaching,2011(04);Application of extensibility case in the teaching of Web application development technology by Huiling Guo. Journal of China environmental management cadre college,2013,23(01);Case driven Web technology and application teaching reform exploration by Dai Tao.China science and education innovation guide,2014(08).Web programming case driven teaching research by Dongmei Guo.Journal of anqing normal university (natural science edition),2016,22(01); and other Scholars discussed the concrete application of case teaching in teaching Web front-end, and also made the relevant beneficial research and exploration in the Web front-end course , Although the project case method is used for teaching, but most of the project cases are just off-line, can only be run in the computer room, lab, not directly to online (such as student write page, not able to run on the Server background, students' learning experience poor, low sense of achievement), and even if some schools have created a project case library website, just provide 183 Copyright © 2018, the Authors.

In order to anticipate the final exam grades of students studying software engineering, this study suggests a learning analytics framework based on machine learning algorithms, using component grades as the source data. The dataset included the academic performance grades of 1475 students who enrolled in a private university for a year to take a Java Web Programming course. To estimate the students' final test grades, the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms' performances―which are among the machine learning algorithms were calculated and compared. A multitude of features, including the assignment, practical exam, two progress test, two workshop, and final exam, were used to make the predictions. Such data-driven research is crucial for developing a framework for learning analytics in higher education and for influencing decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Automated programming assessment systems have transformed the evaluation of programming assignments, providing detailed feedback and reducing instructors' workload. This paper explores the benefits of Git log analysis in ProgEdu, a code-quality aware automated programming assessment system. ProgEdu was utilized for assessing Java homework assignments and web programming projects over two semesters. The integration of Git log analysis in ProgEdu highlights its potential in tracking student progress, predicting performance, determining student groups based on submission behaviors, identifying inequality in group projects, and facilitating instructors' intervention.

    "abstract": "The Merdeka Curriculum brings significant changes to the approaches, strategies, methods, and models of learning. One of the most notable changes can be seen in the Informatics subject. The Algorithm and Programming material is part of the Informatics subject, emphasizing students' ability to develop an application. Unfortunately, SMA N 2 Pontianak faces limitations in computer availability, which hampers the learning process for the Algorithm and Programming material. Therefore, this research aims to develop a feasible learning media using the drill-and-practice approach to support learning activities for the Algorithm and Programming material at SMA N 2 Pontianak. Additionally, this study seeks to understand the responses from users after utilizing the developed learning media. The research method used is the Research and Development (R&D) method with the ADDIE approach. The instruments used include interview guidelines, questionnaires, and documents. The data analysis was conducted using descriptive qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results indicate that the drill-and-practice learning media for the Algorithm and Programming material is effective and appropriate for its intended purpose. \nKeywords: Development, Drill and Practice, Web, Programming Algorithms",

    "abstract": "The platform developed by the researcher, called the \"Code Simulator,\" covers web programming learning materials, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application, which integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages with a website-based code simulator, is a type of software designed to assist students in organizing and evaluating the programming materials taught by teachers through projects in a Project-Based Learning model. This study aims to determine the learning outcomes competency of students after using the Techcode application and applying the project-based learning model in web programming lessons. This research used a quantitative pretest-posttest method. The research design used is the ADDIE method with a prototype development model. The target of this research is students of class XI RPL at SMK PGRI 2 Sidoarjo. The instruments used include validation sheets for learning tools, pretest-posttest question validation sheets, material validation sheets, and question validation sheets. The research results show that the percentage of material validation was 92.5%, Rencana Pelaksanaan Pembelajaran (RPP) validation was 89%, pretest-posttest question validation was 90%, and media or learning tools validation was 95.5%. Based on the results of the T-test, the significance value obtained was <0.001, which means 0.001 < 0.05, so H₀ is rejected and H₁ is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of a website-based learning media can improve students' learning outcome competencies in learning web programming.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of digital technology requires vocational high school graduates to master practical competencies that align with current industrial needs. However, initial observations at SMK Negeri 2 Cimahi revealed that students in the Software Engineering department were still dependent on procedural programming and had very limited exposure to modern frameworks such as Laravel. This competence gap resulted in low readiness to face professional challenges in web development. To address this issue, a community service program was implemented in the form of a Laravel bootcamp that applied a project-based learning approach. The program involved 40 students who were guided through structured activities including technical preparation, introduction to Laravel concepts, project development of a To-Do List application, and comprehensive evaluation. The evaluation results demonstrated clear improvement, with the average pre-test score of 46.25 increasing to 72.80 in the post-test. Further analysis of competency achievement showed that 85% of participants understood the MVC concept, 90% successfully implemented CRUD functions, 80% mastered authentication, 75% presented projects effectively, and 88% demonstrated strong teamwork. These outcomes confirm that project-based bootcamps can effectively bridge the gap between theory and practice, while strengthening technical competence and enriching teaching resources available for schools and higher education institutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines students' perceptions and attitudes toward peer feedback within the course Introduction to Web Programming. The primary aim is to explore how students perceive the contribution of peer evaluation to the enhancement of their projects, the development of reflective thinking, and the strengthening of professional competencies. The research was conducted after the completion of student projects and the peer assessment phase, using a post-activity survey distributed to participating students. The survey was specifically designed to capture students' attitudes and experiences regarding various aspects of the peer feedback process. Responses were analyzed across several categories: technical correctness, visual quality, content relevance of feedback, presentation skills, emotional responses to feedback, sincerity, and reflective engagement. Findings indicate that students generally viewed both giving and receiving peer comments as useful for improving project quality and supporting personal development, especially in relation to evaluation and self-evaluation skills. Moreover, students reported that peer feedback contributed to their critical thinking, boosted self-confidence, and fostered more constructive academic communication. Based on these insights into student perspectives, the study proposes guidelines for the further implementation and improvement of peer assessment practices in technology-related educational settings.",

    "abstract": "The article is devoted to the issues of teaching high school students CSS animation (Cascading Style Sheets) in the framework of extracurricular activities using the gamification method. The current problems of teaching web programming at school are considered, its main components are highlighted: HTML page layout, programming on the client and server sides. The analysis of existing services and online games for teaching web layout is presented. As a result of the analysis of the traffic of the studied services, an increased interest of Internet users in web simulators, implemented using the principles of gamification, was revealed. However, today there are a limited number of such services, in addition, many topics of web programming and layout are still unrealized with the help of such web simulators.The article describes a completed project of developing a web simulator for teaching the basic properties of CSS animation. When designing a web simulator, the requirements for the implementation of game mechanics and dynamics were considered, which will make it possible to organize the educational process in a dynamic, exciting and visual way. The article describes the key features of the web simulator, its functional requirements, provides a rationale for the choice of topics and design of the web simulator, and considers the algorithm of its operation. The topics that are studied as a result of passing tasks in the web simulator are listed. The risks associated with the implementation of the web simulator in the educational process are described.The authors carried out an experiment on the basis of an additional education institution \"KiberOne Programming School\" among 10th grade students, the results of the experiment showed the effectiveness of using the developed web simulator in teaching CSS animation.",

The reading ability of 9-14 years children in Indonesia ranks 40th out of 40 countries studied by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). Efforts to improve society reading interest need to be grown since childhood. One way that the government has taken to grown children's reading interest is through the Gerakan Literasi Sekolah (GLS). However, there are no facilities that can facilitate these activities. This study is to improve society reading interest since junior high school age by facilitating their work through a web-based literacy information system. System developed with Unified Modeling Language (UML) architecture diagrams, implemented using the PHP MySQL web programming language. The results of this study are 82.91% of respondents agree this system can provides convenience and it can facilitate works and upload user’s book summary.",

Research has explored the impact of anonymous engagement via social media on classroom dynamics, revealing that anonymity boosts student participation in both in-person and online sessions. This study concentrates on enhancing the quality of anonymous participation in classrooms and assessing its effect on less active students. Quality participation implies relevant discourse aligned with the subject. While anonymity increases student engagement, it can also lead to disruptions such as cyberbullying. Focusing on object-oriented and web programming university courses, we utilized the ANONI app for data collection, proposing a method to enhance the quality of anonymous engagement. Our approach yielded positive outcomes, with just two instances of off-topic activities, notably fewer than previous studies.",

    "abstract": "The e-Iearning system or distance learning system has become important, especially during the COVID-19 pan-demic. Several tertiary institutions have made the e-Iearning system an alternative teaching and learning activity. Research on the use of e-Iearning needs to be explored to obtain innovative, creative, and fun learning. One aspect that can be examined in e-learning is students' emotional response to the learning activities. The emotional state of students directly or indirectly affects the learning process. The student's emotional responses can be measured by their facial expressions. In this study, an exploration was carried out on the facial expressions shown by students in HSS Learning, an e-Iearning for learning web programming. The student's facial expressions were extracted using 68 pairs of facial landmarks and additional 6 facial feature vectors. The total number of features used is 142. Machine learning methods for classification are applied to determine the performance of several classification models, including the k-Nearest Neighbor (k- NN) algorithm, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Machine learning performance evaluation is done using the Fl-score and confusion matrix. The results show that the accuracy of the k-NN, Logistic Regression, and SVM are 91.4%, 92.2%, and 92.1 %, respectively. However, the Fl-score macro values are relatively low due to data imbalance with the k- NN, Logistic Regression, and SVM models are 0.250, 0.272, and 0.243, respectively. While the study provides insight into the student learning experience in e-Iearning settings, this study needs to be explored more.",

With a website that can be accessed anywhere and at any time, the public can find out information and everything related to the study program. The Jambi University Indonesian Literature Study Program website has been designed by the team with the page https://sastraindonesia.unja.ac.id. However, the website is not managed well so the information presented has not been updated. Apart from that, the layout of the site is also irregular, thereby reducing public interest in accessing the website. In fact, through the study program website you can disseminate information such as profiles, vision and mission, organizational structure, scholarships, student achievements, questionnaires, and news content and other information. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the Indonesian Literature Study Program website at Jambi University as a medium of information for the public. This website management activity begins with the stages of analyzing website needs, collecting website data, designing and filling content, and socializing the website to the public. The result of this service activity is website governance Jambi University's Indonesian Literature Study Program is getting better.

In addition, it provides summarising tools to help users create clear summaries of their work. The study includes a thorough survey of 40 students to determine their requirements and expectations of the system. We also discuss various aspects such as HCI usability, UX design, and common problems encountered by graduating college students. In addition, they describe the common thesis and project management systems in universities around the globe. The system features an interface for project management, a search bar for topic searching, and the BART and T5 models for title generation. The results of the evaluation of the system indicate a high degree of necessity and usability based on student feedback. The study ends with ideas for improvements that could be made in the future, such as a search bar that uses NLP to make it easier to find topics, students, or teachers.",

The objective of this study is to compare appropriate machine-learning models to assess sentiments and Bloom’s epistemic taxonomy based on textual comments in educational discussion forums. The proposed method is called the hierarchical approach of Bloom-Epistemic and Sentiment Analysis (BE-Sent). The research methodology consists of three main steps. The first step is the data collection from the internal discussion forum and YouTube comments of a Web Programming channel. The next step is text preprocessing to annotate the text and clear unimportant words. Furthermore, with the text dataset that has been successfully cleaned, sentiment analysis and epistemic categorization will be done in each sentence of the text. Sentiment analysis is divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Bloom’s epistemic is divided into six categories: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. This research has succeeded in producing a course learning subsystem that assesses opinions based on text reviews of discussion forums according to the category of sentiment and epistemic analysis.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the design, implementation, and evaluation of an instructional strategy using Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots to support web programming (HTML5/CSS/JS) learning in 9th‑grade students from a public school in Monteria (Colombia). We followed a three‑cycle action‑research approach with 35 convenience‑sampled students. The intervention combined standard ChatGPT and a custom GPT (tutor role, curated prompt library, QR access), adapted to a resource‑constrained setting with unstable connectivity. Instruments included a diagnostic test, post‑test, performance rubrics, and a perception survey. Results showed gains in HTML5 structure/semantics, basic styling, and debugging: the average score increased from 3.0 to 4.2/5.0; 80% of students rated the chatbot positively for immediate feedback and availability. Findings align with recent evidence, highlighting opportunities (personalized scaffolding) and risks (hallucinations, bias, digital divide). We conclude that—with teacher mediation and active verification—LLM chatbots strengthen programming learning.",

    "abstract": "Web applications have become immensely popular and widely utilized across various sectors due to their accessibility, scalability, and ability to provide real-time updates, driving the demand for skilled web programmers. Approximately 75.9% of websites that use server-side languages rely on PHP, a widely adopted and flexible scripting language that integrates seamlessly with databases, making it suitable for dynamic website development. As the complexity of web development increases, self-learning systems become essential for fostering independent programming skills through platforms such as learning management systems (LMS) and MOOCs; however, many of these tools still require human intervention for code verification and lack automated feedback mechanisms. This study proposes a self-learning framework that leverages test-driven development (TDD) to enhance PHP programming education. The framework enables students to participate in structured learning modules, receive realtime feedback, and refine their coding abilities. An evaluation with 150 first-year IT students in Indonesia demonstrated a 100% success rate in all modules, where success was defined as the ability of students to pass all test cases in the predefined test suites after multiple attempts. This highlights the framework’s effectiveness while also noting areas for improvement in content depth and instructional clarity.",

    "abstract": "Students tend to copy programming assignments from their classmates in programming courses. Students copy codes in various ways, such as changing variable names and code structure order. Lecturers spend much time checking programming assignments, especially when the number of students enrolled in the course is large. They must check whether students have completed their programming assignments individually or copied their classmates' assignments. We developed a JavaScript code similarity detection application for web programming coursework using lexical analysis and Jero Winkler's Algorithm. Our application can detect the level of the students’ programming assignment similarity and assist the lecturer in deciding on plagiarism. ",
