    "abstract": "Background & Objectives: Digitalisation across the globe has massively expanded the use of the internet and technology which can benefit in making physiology education more diverse, inclusive and culturally responsive. Access to a wealth of educational resources through digital platforms has democratized learning, particularly in areas where physical resources may be limited. Social Media can enable students from diverse backgrounds to access physiology education from institutions worldwide, providing options that suit individual needs and schedules.The purpose of this study is to understand the role that social media could play as an effcient learning tool to promote an equitable and inclusive learning environment in physiology. Methods: This survey-based study was conducted among Health Profession students of the medical and nursing fields using a structured questionnaire with 12 items. The opinions of students towards using social media as an emerging learning tool in physiology education were obtained on a 5-point Likert scale and studied under 3 themes- i) Utility in Medical Education, iii) Dependence and iii) Personal Practices. The opinions were compared on the basis of time that medical and nursing students could dedicate to social media for learning owing to their busy academic schedule. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) of all continuous variables were descriptively analysed using univariate statistics and the differences were compared using T-test, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Mann–Whitney U test and Krushkall Wallis test were performed to identify differences in non-normal distribution. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 17) for Microsoft Windows, SPSS Inc. USA was used. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Our study included 50% medical and 50% nursing students with over 90% of them using social media. Highly positive responses for the utility of social media in physiology education indicate welcoming attitudes towards technology-based learning to promote inclusivity. However medical students perceived that their schedule is too busy to participate in social media (p-value < 0.05). Also, 78% were either unsure or believed social media would consume a lot of time. Even though students routinely used social media, the accuracy and reliability of social media as a learning tool was a major concern among students. Conclusion: Our study underscores the promise of social media as a powerful tool for enhancing inclusivity in physiology education. The enthusiasm of students for using these platforms in their learning journey is evident. However, the demanding schedules of medical students and concerns about resource reliability must be acknowledged as potential roadblocks. To unlock the full potential of social media in physiology education, it is imperative that educational institutions and educators address these challenges through strategic planning and assurance measures. By doing so, we can create an educational landscape that is both equitable and of high quality, where all students can benefit from the advantages of social media in their learning. This research serves as a call to action, encouraging further exploration and innovation in this field, ultimately advancing the delivery of physiology education in the digital age.

    "abstract": "As class sizes grow, providing high-quality, accurate, timely feedback\n on student projects becomes increasingly difficult for instructors. This\n research explores the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) to\n assist instructors in providing student feedback. The authors hypothesized\n that AI Large Language Models can provide valuable, accurate, and timely\n feedback on student papers in a physiology class. The tested sample\n comprised thirty-two written papers of around 1.5 to 3 pages in length, each\n evaluating two medical TV drama episodes across seven point scale rubric\n categories. Since the papers were sampled from a pre-existing data set, they\n had previously been scored with a point scale rubric once (human existing)\n by a single reviewer. Papers were de-identified and rescored by three\n independent reviewers (human new, scores averaged) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n (July 1, 2024 version). Investigators looked at the time to completion,\n written feedback, and rubric point scale scoring. Point scale scoring was\n the only consistent comparison across all three evaluations. This is because\n Human existing scores did not initially include written feedback and time to\n completion. Human new scores did not include written feedback in order to\n mimic the original scoring workflow. We prompted AI to include written\n feedback as an experimental extension since this required no additional\n effort. A one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences\n between the existing human scores (human existing), the new human scores\n (human new), and the scores generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet (F = 0.12, p =\n 0.89), indicating high accuracy for each scoring method. Human new scoring\n took an average of 3 minutes and 19 seconds for each paper with no written\n feedback. AI completed its assessment, which included written feedback, in\n under 10 seconds per paper. The instructor judged AI feedback to be robust,\n accurate, and highly relevant. The results suggest that AI could enhance\n academic performance by directly providing students with quality feedback\n before submitting an assignment. This could also free the instructor to\n focus on teaching and curriculum development. Future research should explore\n productive workflows and methods of assessment for AI-assisted student work\n that promote targeted learning outcomes.\n This project was funded by the Department of Physiology at Michigan\n State University\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "The paper presents the use of information and communications technology to enhance the learning in case of a laboratory module, called \"Loop forming processes\" within the curricula of \"Basis of Knitting Technology\" course. Among the designed and used means for the learning module are those frequently used in case of knitting technology such as: html interactive animations showing the successive phases of loop forming cycle, electronic albums, video clips. All these means offer the possibility for an interactive and programmed learning of the \"Loop forming processes\" and an easy understanding of the loop forming phases during of the knitting cycle in case of spring bearded needles, latch needles and compound needles. Corel Draw was used for the drawings, Corel Rave for the interactive animations and video camera, for the video clips. The laboratory module was designed based on an XML file taken as a model, amended contents according to the needs of the laboratory and then used for transformation in the HTML laboratory module using the ModulEst application. The laboratory module has an interactive graphical structure and contains navigation icons for direct access to the bibliography, webography, glossary, summary help page and test for self-programming and verification. The learning modules are accompanied by three different online quizzes that were used at the three stages of learning module: at the beginning of the learning module, to evaluate the students prior knowledge, during the learning module, to see students progress as they learn (assessment for learning) and at the end of the learning module, to gauge the students received knowledge (assessment of learning). The authors consider the designed modules as innovative learning methods that support learning in engineering education at the Faculty of Textiles-Leather and Industrial Management.",

    "abstract": "Students find pulmonary physiology difficult and complex. Information overload is a strong deterrent of learning and decreases motivation. Function diagrams are simplified renditions of a complex system that can house a series of analogies and mnemonics for the purpose of concept elaboration and knowledge retrieval. This lung function diagram uses the five lobes (3 of the right and 2 of the left) to link several analogies that when put together describes the major lung functions. The five lobes correspond to (i) Lung compliance & surface tension, (ii) Mechanics of breathing & airway resistance, (iii) Control of breathing, (iv) Gas diffusion and oxygen transport, and (v) Ventilation-perfusion matching. Each lobe serves as a memory palace location for one of the five items but the lobe housing an item has no anatomical relation. The first image is of someone doing a belly flop while holding a big, medium, and small balloon. The small balloon represents thick-walled hard-to-inflate balloon (analogy of fibrosed lung), the medium balloon medium-walled normally-inflated (analogy of normal lung), and the big balloon represents a thin-walled easily-inflated balloon (higher compliance). The belly flop represents water’s high surface tension. The second image is of a mechanic turning on a water spicket. Here the mechanic represents the mechanics involved in respiration. The flow of a liquid out the spicket represents narrow vs. wider aperture extrapolates to air flow and determinants of airway resistance, especially if different size hoses are attached. The third image is of a computer circuit board connected to a small motor. This represents the regulation of respiration, accepting inputs and back-and-forth circuitry with outputs to increase or decrease the speed of the motor or ventilation. The forth image is of a car filled with three commuters returning home (blood flow returning to the lungs) and soda cans and baking soda in the trunk. In this image the four-seat car represents hemoglobin with its four oxygen binding sites, each passenger is an oxygen. The soda represents dissolved carbon dioxide, baking soda represents bicarbonate, and the trunk is the hemoglobin site that binds to carbon dioxide. Passengers getting into of the car and soda cans and baking soda being unloaded from the trunk represents O2 and CO2 binding/unbinding. The final image of gas tanks traveling down a conveyer belt to be filled. Here the gas filling rate of partially filled cylinders represents ventilation, the speed of belt carrying these cylinders represents perfusion. Our overall premise is that simple witty memorable diagrams, function diagrams, that do not look like a detailed figures and graphs may facilitate elaboration and decrease perceived perplexity of learning difficult topics such as pulmonary physiology.

The three-dimensional models are accompanied by questions to be answered by students. The application was  used in classes of Biomedicine of Universidade Severino Sombra (USS) and was evaluated by the students through spontaneous comments and Likert five-point questionnaire with questions covering usability, structure of the application and its use as a learning tool.

HYPOTHESIS:\n We predicted the majority of students would describe course structure in\n relation to UDL and transferable skills. METHODOLOGY & DATA: Of the 315\n enrolled students, 295 students completed the final course reflection and\n 138 signed informed consent forms to allow their responses to be used for\n the study (n=138/295, 46.8% participation rate). Through qualitative content\n analysis, we developed an initial codebook, revised the codebook, and\n exceeded the 0.80 threshold for Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) using\n Krippendorff's Alpha to establish the final codebook. To support data\n triangulation, we also used an AI-powered tool with commercial data\n protection to analyze student responses by copying about 30% of student\n responses (n=42/138) into Microsoft Copilot (UGA internal server) with\n prompts to develop themes and compare these themes to our final codebook.\n RESULTS: Through deductive coding of student responses, we constructed the\n following categories in our final codebook: (1) Weekly Classroom Assessment\n Techniques (Muddy Mondays, Working Wednesdays, Freaky Fridays) and (2)\n Additional Aspects of Course Structure, both in-class (e.g., Core Concepts,\n PLAs, Rainchecks) or outside of class (e.g., practice questions,\n supplemental videos). Preliminary results from a single coder show over 70%\n of students (n=102/138) described in detail how aspects of the course\n structure were useful for them in other contexts and supported their\n learning. Nearly 55% of students describe some aspect of UDL principles in\n their responses. To ensure scientific rigor and bias reduction, validation\n of the codebook is underway with two unbiased coders who achieved IRR,\n independently reviewed student responses, and are coding to consensus.\n CONCLUSIONS: Students overall show evidence of applying strategies from a\n single course to other courses to support study habits and collaborative\n learning. Our study offers a comprehensive overview of multiple components\n of course structure that students cite as supporting transferable skill\n development with implications for education researchers who assess and\n instructors who apply active learning strategies in instructional design for\n undergraduate physiology courses.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format. There is no downloadable file or PDF\n version. The Physiology editorial board was not involved in the peer review\n process.",

    "abstract": "Prior to Fall 2023, the two medical campuses of the University of Minnesota, have hadtwo different curricula. Though the Duluth campus has delivered an integrative, systems-based curriculum, the Twin Cities campus has delivered a discipline-basedcurriculum. Outcome measures (1) pass rate and scores on Step 1 board exams, 2)graduation data and 3) match success) demonstrate strong comparability betweenthe two curricula. Starting in September 2020, another opportunity for comparisonoccurred; a single instructor taught pulmonary content to both the Duluth (Fall 2020)and Twin Cities (Spring 2020) cohorts and another single instructor taughtcardiovascular content to both the Duluth (Fall 2020) and Twin Cities (Spring 2021)cohorts. Both cohorts were given and assessed on the same set of learning objectives;leading us to ask the following question: Does the structure of the preclinical curriculum(systems vs discipline-based) impact the learning outcomes of physiology, particularlythe ability to integrate material? We compared the two cohorts by comparing acommon set of exam questions assessing cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology. Wemeasured question performance by question diffculty index (expressed as a percent)and question cognitive level by determining the Bloom’s Taxonomy Cognitive level(knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation). We foundno differences between the cohorts in question diffculty as a function of content typeor levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. We conclude that there was no difference in overallperformance of the Duluth and Twin Cities cohorts despite receiving different curricularapproaches. However, we had an unexpected finding from the analytics; thecardiovascular items were significantly more diffcult than the pulmonary items. Thisresult has implications for a team-taught medical school curriculum given the source ofthe difference could be the difference in teaching style, the difference in content or thedifference in item writing. We therefore are beginning an exploration of the differencein item analysis and possible impacts on student evaluations. The important of this lineof inquiry is that first, consistency in item diffculty potentially impacts a competencybased medical curriculum and second, how students perceive differences in itemdiffculty has the potential to affects instructor evaluations and therefore promotionand tenure.

    "abstract": "Extracurriculars in education are intended to answer the demands of student’s needs. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will be assisted with creative learning patterns that can increase creativity. In fact, in limited school hours there are many activities that cannot always be carried out, so extracurriculars are created where the implementation is carried out outside school hours to accommodate students in meeting their needs, interests and talents. The management of the extracurricular information system at SMA X has problems, where students sometimes do not get information such as schedules, grades, extracurricular activities and extracurricular registration is done by submitting registration forms where this activity results in file accumulation, which is of course very ineffective nowadays. \n  \nFrom the existing problems, the researchers created a web-based extracurricular management information system with HTML, PHP, Bootstrap and database programming languages. This system was tested using the usability testing method which was directly tested on extracurricular members. The method used in the development of the system is the waterfall method. This system is expected to facilitate the extracurricular information management process and can provide extensive information about the extracurricular activities themselves, so that the information provided is not broken down and integrated in one system and can be useful for students, teachers and schools.",

    "abstract": "Inequities and achievement gaps exist for students from groups underrepresented in medicine (URiM) and for English language learners (ELLs). This is particularly evident with multiple choice assessments which are prevalent in health professions and medical education. Increasing the linguistic accessibility of test items by simplifying the language used while keeping the content diffculty was perceived as helpful to ELLs in an undergraduate Chemistry course (Lee & Orgill, 2022). Following best practices when writing exam questions provides consistent and valid measures of student comprehension. Across institutions we face similar challenges when forming and assessing multiple choice questions for our physiology exams. Some major flaws include long complex options; using vague terms; negatively structured stems; grammatical cues; word repeats. Lopez (2023) found that 56% items contained at least one flaw. The most common flaws identified were those in which the items were not approximately the same length and item options that did not have parallel grammatical form and structure. In order to address these issues in an objective way, we collectively modified the previously detailed rubric (Lopez, 2023) for identifying common flaws based on the “Item-Writing Guide” from the National Board of Medical Education (NBME®) and one formed in the context of general chemistry by Breakall et al. (2019). Twenty-six questions from physiology exams at three different institutions were evaluated by three faculty using the newly created rubric. After analyzing the questions, we returned as a group and compared our individual ratings, clarified any discrepancies and modified the rubric accordingly. We will conduct statistical analysis to assess our inter-rater reliability score before using this rubric to analyze the full question banks for physiology exams at each institution. This process is not limited to physiology educators since it can be utilized by teachers in any program or discipline. The significance of the work will not only benefit our validation of learning but it will also address specific equity issues by eliminating flaws that provide irrelevant diffculty or benefit test wise students. Furthermore, this rubric is also helpful in generating new questions for future exams, ensuring equitable assessments. References: Breakall, J., Randles, C., & Tasker, R. (2019).

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of an interactive web-based platform aimed at enhancing English language learning through the utilization of digital twins, powered by the GPT-3.5 model. The platform integrates three primary services essential for language learning: vocabulary acquisition, grammar checking, and conversational practice via simulated interlocutors, offering a dynamic, personalized learning experience. Detailed technical aspects of the system’s architecture are discussed, highlighting the implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, which ensures modularity and scalability. The platform’s backend is developed using C# for reliability and performance, while the frontend leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive, user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.\nTo support large volumes of user data, a Microsoft Azure SQL Database is employed for robust data management, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user information, interaction histories, and progress logs. Integration with GPT-3.5 via OpenAI's API facilitates real-time query processing and response generation, making the platform a powerful tool.\nThe platform uses advanced personalization algorithms to adjust learning content based on user preferences, progress, and interaction history. This personalized approach increases student engagement and promotes more effective learning outcomes by adapting content to individual needs.\nSecurity and ethical considerations are addressed through encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms. In addition, OpenAI’s built-in content filtering systems ensure that inappropriate or harmful content is blocked, safeguarding users while maintaining high ethical standards. Furthermore, a detailed cost calculation model for token usage is presented, which allows for precise tracking of operational costs, ensuring the platform’s long-term sustainability.\nBy integrating cutting-edge technology with pedagogical principles, this platform demonstrates the potential to revolutionize English language learning in higher education institutions, making it more interactive, personalized, and effective.",

This issue is very common for all Latvian higher education institutions as well as other higher education institutions outside of Latvia. It became clear after reading the new changes of the Law of Higher Education of the Republic of Latvia that two major changes had to be made first in course descriptions: updating the course descriptions to the new requirements and creating a mapping of the study programs. The decision was made to start work on a Course Management System. The goal purpose was to create a Course Management System that will help professors with developing course descriptions and will help study program directors to reach study program aims through learning outcomes. At first together with students the authors did a detailed analysis of the system and then developed it. Now the system is ready for implementation. Thanks to the developed system at Ventspils University of Applied Sciences has solved several important issues related to the course descriptions. For study programme learning outcome alignment with study course learning outcome will be used matrix method.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted education, particularly in\n secondary institutions, prompting a shift to blended and online learning\n environments. This study explores the correlation between non-traditional\n students and traditional students in their first year of osteopathic medical\n school. Non-traditional is defined as gap year students, graduate students,\n and post-baccalaureate students while traditional students include\n undergraduates who enrolled in courses directly from high school, attended\n full-time, and have limited life and work responsibilities. We conducted a\n survey of a 175 osteopathic medical students at the conclusion of their\n first academic year to assess academic performance and preparedness. 24\n respondents provided scores from a six-week introductory basic science\n course (M2P) and a first-year nervous system course (NVS1). Additionally,\n students detailed their educational settings (online, hybrid, or in-person)\n and test-taking styles (such as open-book, closed-book, lockdown browser,\n and handwritten formats). Emotional indices were obtained at the end of the\n first year curriculum. Respondents were asked to judge their psychological\n preparedness (Emotional Index Score) before matriculation and at the\n conclusion of year one coursework to understand the psychological\n preparedness of both groups. Preliminary findings suggest that\n non-traditional students were slightly more confident in their abilities\n prior to matriculation compared to the traditional students. The\n non-traditional groupings also gained confidence and reported higher index\n scores at the conclusion of coursework and at the completion of the first\n year. Academic performance metrics reveal that the non-traditional students\n performed similarly throughout the year as the traditional students. These\n findings suggest that non-traditional students may feel more emotionally\n prepared for the rigor of medical school prior to matriculation. This study\n highlights the nuanced differences in preparedness and performance between\n non-traditional and traditional medical students in their first year. Our\n findings underscore the importance of understanding the unique challenges\n and strengths each group faces, particularly in the context of adapting to\n new learning modalities prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research\n is needed to explore long-term implications on academic success and\n emotional well-being in medical education.\n Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine Research Office\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Animal dissections are a common approach to teaching anatomy and physiology, but they are costly, pose safety risks, and raise ethical concerns. Alternatives like computer simulations and synthetic specimens have been explored, but they lack the realism of live dissections. Virtual reality (VR) technology provides a promising solution by immersing learners in a virtual environment that closely mimics real-life dissections and allows for skill development and feedback. VR also removes ethical and emotional concerns associated with dissections and enhances learning opportunities. To explore the effectiveness of VR in anatomy and physiology education, we conducted a detailed survey of 48 students in an undergraduate physiology laboratory course. The survey, administered before and after students performed both a VR frog dissection and an in-person frog dissection, was designed to gauge their perceptions, preferences, and learning experiences with both methods. Results indicate that while no participants considered VR a perfect substitute, a majority (80%) still viewed animal dissections as an essential part of science laboratory courses. Interestingly, 43% of participants expressed a stronger preference for live dissections post-experiment, citing greater excitement and perceived informativeness. In contrast, 25% favored VR or alternative methods, highlighting increased comfort and reduced discomfort. A recurring theme was VR's role as a preparatory or alternative tool for those hesitant towards live dissection. This study underscores VR's potential in addressing traditional dissection methods' limitations and emphasizes the need for further research into VR's effectiveness in anatomy and physiology education. We aim to foster dialogue on the use of alternative technologies in enhancing learning opportunities within laboratory and clinical sciences.

Every information that attractive and easy to understanding is very important to give big impact for every primary school student, it also can provide a pleasant learning experience for these students. Therefore, this research develops a smartphone application that can provide a pleasant experience in learning knowledge of the surrounding environment from objects with virtual reality technology. To display these objects, a 360 ° panoramic image is used or a 2048px width 1024px width with a wide viewing angle (360 degrees) and this can be done by teachers to make the image or search for material sources on the internet. This technology allows students to see objects virtually. In use, this study requires a VR headset as a device for visualizing stereoscopic displays but it does not need installation because it is enough to access a smartphone browser then it will work. The system is designed using the spiral method as a process model and uses a-frame in application development. The interface can be run on the Android operating system. In making this application using the html programming language, laravel framework and a-frame framework.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are options for training IT specialists in the educational services market. They overwhelmingly do not take into account the student’s personal characteristics, as well as the market needs in labors. To solve these problems, the authors have developed software complex SkillsForYou (in the Python programming language), which has a modular structure that allows implementing support for the IT specialists training based on the cycle of automated management of training IT specialists (based on the theory of organizational systems management and consisting of stages of planning, organization, stimulation, control). The SkillsForYou contains a large number of training courses of different complexity in various languages and programming technologies (Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP). The complex includes a module for analyzing the personal and psychological learner’s qualities, which contains many different psychological tests to assess the quality formation-level necessary for IT specialists, and the specialist team formation to collaborate on projects. The mathematical module on the psychological testing results and the results of calculations using swarm intelligence algorithms determine recommendations for organizing the learning process for each learner. Swarm intelligence algorithms use statistics on the complexity of the problems selected for solving. Problems for training courses are in accordance with the taxonomy of Bloom's training goals, and to assess the problem complexity to solve, the course teacher assigns a cost to the problems. In order to facilitate the search for applicants by HR specialists and employers the software complex stores the education history in the learning courses and the learners’ rating.",

    "abstract": "Online learning is the modern version of distance learning. Driven by the readily available and easily accessible digital technology and the necessity to deliver classes online during the recent pandemic, it has surpassed previous forms of distance learning in its popularity and impact to become the new normal in education in many parts of the world. Apart from technological and environmental factors, effective online course delivery relies on appropriate instructional design and good pedagogical practices to engage and motivate students. This paper describes an interactive approach of online course delivery with H5P integration, a plugin with enriched HTML 5 content to existing lecture videos that enables interactions between the instructor and students and among students. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated with student quiz scores in two undergraduate linguistics courses delivered face-to-face in a classroom and asynchronous online respectively. While the quiz scores of the latter were slightly lower, no statistically significant difference was found, indicating the asynchronous online class with H5P integration produced similar learning outcomes.",

This paper elucidates the role of matrix manipulation in animating figures on screens, elucidates the distinctions between Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), bitmap and raster images, and unveils the inner workings of the Bresenham algorithm in the context of rendering lines on screens. Furthermore, the article offers a practical dimension to this theoretical understanding by providing a comprehensive example of code written in JavaScript for generating an animation, also using HTML and CSS. This code example is designed to be easy to comprehend, even to those with limited programming experience, fostering the integration of animations into life science education. We synthesized findings from various studies to underscore the proven advantages of this new teaching tool, and by reviewing them, we reaffirm that animations have a demonstrable impact on improving the learning experience, making complex physiological processes more comprehensible and engaging. This highlights the critical role of animations as a pedagogical tool in science classrooms, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the mathematical and computational principles that support their creation. By bridging this knowledge gap, educators and students can make more effective and informed use of existing animation tools.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Physiology Education began publishing papers in 2005, using classic papers in physiology teaching [1]. This approach has several valuable outcomes: Classic experiments, conclusion of which form the foundation of much of our undergraduate teaching textbooks, require less specialized knowledge to understand and interpret the data and conclusions. It demonstrates the scientific method, demonstrating both \"what do we know\" and \"how do we know.\" It promotes inquiry-based learning. It fosters data literacy, teaching students to interpret graphs and provides historical context for physiology [1]. Traditional practical classes achieve many of these outcomes while also providing a tactile experience, and have added benefits to students’ data literacy — in as much as the students perform the protocols themselves. Students will gain insight to what “squiggly lines” on a screen are measuring and the individual variability in what raw physiological recordings look like. Students will gain a greater appreciation for analytical techniques, and the manipulations and analysis that needs to be performed to interpret data. Students also gain an appreciation of the difference between textbook vs real data. Nevertheless, in person practical classes have limitations due to resource intensity, including space, materials, and curriculum time. HumMod (hummod.org) is a freely available mathematical model of Human Physiology, a \"time-dependent physiologic simulation engine\" [2]. JustPhysiology (justphysiology.com) is an education-focused web interface for HumMod [3]. We have written four physiology-based workshops utilizing simulated data from JustPhysiology. The JustPhysiology workshops were setup as a structured inquiry activity where students are expected to apply their content knowledge to interpret data, and students submitted their reports after each workshop for evaluation and feedback. In preparing the workshop activities for deployment, we trialed the activities with students who had previously completed our second year Human Physiology subject (and were thus familiar with the content). We then engaged students in focus group interviews —ascertaining the students’ perceptions of the learning experience. The outcome of the focus group interview suggests that students engaging with the workshop tasks enter into a positive learning cycle: [Formula: see text] The spontaneous emergence of a learning cycle, promoting deeper understanding of the physiology suggests that these data driven workshops will have improve student learning in Human Physiology.

    "abstract": "In light of the overturning of Roe v. Wade & the emergence of\n medically unfounded laws, understanding undergraduate (UG) students'\n knowledge on reproduction is vital. Undergraduate (UG) students represent\n the future voters & leaders in our country. We believe it is important\n to understand their knowledge of this aspect of physiology given the\n importance of reproductive freedoms & their connection to medical\n knowledge. Currently, there is little information about these topics\n reported in the literature. We surveyed UG students to gather their\n understanding of reproductive knowledge relevant to abortion & the\n source of this knowledge. We asked the following research questions: 1. What\n relevant knowledge do UG students have concerning reproductive physiology\n related to pregnancy & embryonic development? 2. What sources of\n knowledge do UG students disclose about these topics? A survey was designed\n to assess UG knowledge of reproduction & pregnancy-related topics\n including definitions & timeline of pregnancy, heart development, pain\n sensation, & age of viability. Five open-ended questions assessed\n student knowledge of these topics. Each question was followed by the\n open-ended question of “How do you know this information?” The survey was\n distributed on social media by members of the research team. In total, 72\n responses were collected between July 2022 & February 2023 & then\n analyzed. Question responses were analyzed using multiple rounds of coding,\n as described by Saldana. First, research team members sought ‘answers’ for\n each content question using medical journals & textbooks. Next, all\n responses to that content question were reviewed by the researcher who\n compiled ‘correct’ answers using an open coding process. Responses were\n scored for correctness & assigned a code. Source of knowledge responses\n were scored by a single researcher using an initial framework informed by\n Hadad and Simonson et al. The initial codebook for each question was\n presented to the full research team for review & critique. This was\n followed by code mapping for each survey question & a second round of\n coding. All rounds of coding used the constant comparative method &\n changes to codes or code assignment were discussed to consensus. Coding\n choices were entered into a spreadsheet for ease of comparing the\n relationship between answer correctness & source of knowledge. Overall,\n 38 correct answers within 360 content question responses (10.6%) were\n provided by participants. Two content questions had no correct answers\n provided. Participants had various misconceptions about the definition of\n pregnancy, the timeline of pregnancy & the developmental processes &\n timing within the human embryo/ fetus. The sources of knowledge were grouped\n into 6 categories – content expert (10%), formal source (14.4%), informal\n source/ popular culture (9.4%), personal experience (0.5%), personal\n knowledge/ opinion (19.4%), & no source (46.1%). Only six correct\n answers were claimed to be known because of knowledge conveyed by a content\n expert or peer reviewed source (15.8%). This study begins to address this\n gap in our knowledge concerning UG student knowledge & their\n misconceptions of human reproduction. Given the absence of pregnancy\n information in national learning objectives, it might not be surprising that\n so few students were able to provide a correct answer & that they didn’t\n cite a content expert or peer-reviewed source as the source of this\n knowledge. However, if we intend to educate the next generation of voters\n & leaders, how are we providing them relevant knowledge to the current\n events of our day? This study underscores the need for educational\n adjustments to enhance UG understanding of reproductive physiology in the\n context of contemporary issues.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Medical students must master an extensive amount of basic science\n knowledge in the first year of the curriculum. The large number of lecturers\n and contact hours may make it difficult for students to ascertain key\n concepts in the material. Physiology faculty members have created extensive\n notes and PowerPoints to assist student comprehension. Study guides,\n practice questions, and review sessions are also provided in the coursework\n to help students determine the highest-yield topics for success. However,\n these supplemental resources are typically provided or utilized after the\n lecture content is presented. For this study, the physiology course notes\n were revised to contain callout boxes with metacognitive “clues” to help\n students plan their study time more efficiently. It was hypothesized that\n these clues would be positively perceived by students and improve their\n grades on summative assessments. The callout boxes classified the content in\n the first year of the physiology curriculum into categories. These included:\n 1. Building Block: This background knowledge is necessary for success; 2.\n VIC (Very Important Concept): This is a high-yield topic for assessments; 3.\n Know by Heart: You need to memorize this equation or numbers for reference;\n 4. Apply It: You will be asked to apply this information to novel clinical\n scenarios; 5. Tricky, Tricky: This is a common area of student\n misconceptions; 6. Numbers Ninja: These values need to be memorized/You\n should be prepared to complete a calculation. 7. No Numbers: Please focus on\n the concept rather than the specific values. 8. Back Pocket: This topic is\n being introduced but will be expanded upon more fully in upcoming lectures.\n The use of the metacognitive clues significantly increased medical student\n scores when compared to the previous cohort of the class, with an increase\n of 3.42% on summative assessments (P=0.02, t-test, n=164-166). On anonymous\n online surveys, medical students reported that the callout boxes were\n utilized when studying the course material, were perceived to be helpful,\n did not distract them when studying, and enabled them to study more\n efficiently. One student described, \" Medical school is about more than just\n studying; it’s also about what you study and how you study. When professors\n explicitly indicate what we should devote our time to, it makes expectations\n clearer and learning easier.” Of the 53 respondents for the survey, 98%\n indicated that they felt callout boxes should be added to additional\n sections of the medical curriculum. These results suggest that metacognitive\n clues can subjectively improve the experience of medical students in a busy\n curriculum and improve performance on summative assessments. Future studies\n will analyze the effectiveness of these strategies with more complex\n physiological topics in the second year of the curriculum.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Background & Objectives: Traditional physiological education predominantly relies on lecture-based teaching, which can be insuffcient for effectively engaging students and preparing them for the ever- evolving and collaborative healthcare landscape. Gamification offers a promising alternative to bridge this educational gap. Gamification is emerging as an active learning innovation in medical education to enhance student engagement and promote life-long learning in a unique and collaborative environment. The CARBGAME - CArd & Board GAmes in Medical Education was introduced and evaluated for its effectiveness in enhancing the active learning, application, sharing and assessment of knowledge in teams in cardiovascular physiology via gamification context. Methods: This mixed-method study involved 150 Phase I MBBS students. Prior to the game, students completed a pre-test with 20 multiple-choice questions and were divided into 25 small groups to compete in the board game designed for Cardiovascular Physiology. The students took turns throwing the dice and answering the questions on the game board and cards to continue moving forward. The first team to reach 100 and solve the case-based question was deemed the winner. Following the Board game, the post-test was conducted to evaluate the improvement in knowledge. Then, the students evaluated the effectiveness of CARBGAME- Cardiovascular Physiology using a 33-item questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale. The feedback regarding CARBGAME- Cardiovascular Physiology was obtained on a 10-point rating scale and for qualitative analysis, students’ and faculties’ perceptions was recorded in in-depth small group interviews. All data were collected anonymous. The continuous variables' Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) were descriptively analyzed using univariate statistics, and the T-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the differences. The Krushkall Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to find variations in the non-normal distribution. The statistical package used was SPSS, version 17, developed by SPSS Inc. USA for Microsoft Windows. A P value of less than 0.05 was deemed significant. Results: Most of the students were multimodal (40%) and Kinaesthetic (33%) learners. A highly significant improvement in knowledge was evident with the pre-test score of 6.5 (1.1) (Mean & Standard Deviation) to 15.3 (1.7) in the post-test with a p-value less than 0.0001. CARBGAME has received exceptional positive responses from students in terms of creating fun (99%), relevant content (94.5%), consistency in rules (96.4%), less complexity (86.5%), active discovery (98.39%), motivation (96.4%), meaningful (99%) and experiential learning (97.3%), social learning (96.4%), fair time period (85.%6), sustainability (90%), effective feedback (95.5%), low stakes method (98.2%), reinforcing learning (96.4%), assessing knowledge (99%), competition (92.8%), collaborative learning (98.2%) and sense of accomplishment (96.39%). All the students and faculties have perceived and rated CARBGAME highly positively. Conclusion: The CARBGAME for cardiovascular physiology innovation has not only met pedagogical ideals but also sparked a transformation in medical education. By emphasizing individualization, feedback, active learning, motivation, social interaction, scaffolding, transfer of knowledge, and effective assessment, this dynamic approach resonates with both faculties and students. The enthusiastic responses from both faculty and students signify an imperative shift in the conventional medical curriculum. These responses highlight the exigent need to introduce innovative elements, such as educational games, to enhance student engagement and cultivate more profound and lasting learning experiences within physiology education. By demonstrating that gamified learning can be a driving force for change in physiology and medical education, this innovation paves the way for a more adaptable, engaging, and effective approach for optimising the learning experience of learners.

    "abstract": "Background: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming\n educational practices, particularly in assessment. While AI may support the\n students in idea generation and summarization of source materials, it also\n introduces challenges related to content validity, academic integrity, and\n the development of critical thinking skills. Educators need strategies to\n navigate these complexities and maintain rigorous, ethical assessments that\n promote higher-order cognitive skills. Aims: This manuscript provides\n practical guidance for educators on designing take-home assessments (e.g.\n research-based assignments) in the AI era. It explores how AI can be\n leveraged to enhance student learning during these assessment tasks and\n offers educators the ability to develop personalized feedback while\n maintaining academic integrity and avoiding potential risks to students'\n skill development. Description: Twelve tips are presented, organized into\n four key areas: (1) Co-developing AI literacy among students and educators,\n (2) designing assessments that prioritize process over output, (3)\n validating learning through AI-free assessments, and (4) preparing students\n for AI-enhanced workplaces by developing AI communication skills and\n promoting human-AI collaboration. These strategies emphasize ethical AI use,\n personalized feedback, and creativity. Methodology: This guidance was\n developed through a collaborative, consensus-driven process involving a\n consortium of three educators with diverse academic backgrounds, career\n stages, and perspectives on AI in education. Members, holding experience in\n higher education across the UK, USA, Australia, and MENA regions, brought\n varied insights into AI’s role in education. The team engaged in an\n iterative process of refining recommendations through fortnightly virtual\n meetings and offline discussions. Conclusion: By adopting these approaches,\n educators can balance the benefits and risks of AI in assessments, fostering\n authentic learning while preparing students for the challenges of an\n AI-driven world.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Effective education requires a strong partnership between\n students and teachers. Central to this partnership is trust, particularly\n students trusting their teachers. For trust to develop, teachers must\n demonstrate that they are relatable and genuinely care about their students'\n success. One potential strategy to build trust is through short, individual\n meetings between students and teachers early in the semester. The purpose of\n this study was to determine whether an early-semester meeting impacts the\n level of trust students have in their teacher and improves student outcomes.\n It was hypothesized that such a meeting would enhance student trust in the\n teacher and lead to better academic performance. Methods: This study was\n conducted in a 200-level introductory physiology class with 424 students. Of\n these, 348 students participated in individual 5-minute meetings with the\n professor during the first three weeks of class. These meetings included\n students answering four \"get to know you\" questions. Midway through the\n semester, a survey was distributed to all students. The survey collected\n information on grade expectations at the beginning of the semester,\n self-reported midterm grades, and responses to open-ended questions about\n why they met with the instructor and how the meeting influenced their\n perception of the instructor. Chi-square analyses were performed on grade\n expectations and midterm grades, while a thematic analysis was conducted on\n the open-ended responses. Results: There was no difference in grade\n expectations prior to the start of the semester between students who\n completed the meeting and those who did not. However, students who completed\n the meeting had significantly better grades than those who did not ( p =\n 0.018). A primary theme that emerged from the open-ended responses was that\n these meetings fostered a positive relationship with the instructor.\n Additionally, the meetings helped students better understand the\n instructor's role not only as a grader but also as a teacher and a source of\n support in the learning process. Conclusions: These data suggest\n early-semester individual meetings between students and instructors can\n significantly enhance student outcomes and foster trust by creating positive\n relationships. These meetings help redefine the instructor’s role as a\n supportive guide in the learning process, rather than solely a grader. This\n approach highlights the importance of establishing early, personalized\n connections to improve academic performance and student perceptions of their\n instructor.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

However, with the advancement of technology, there is a need for an e-learning system that can facilitate the teaching and learning process and provide more varied learning activities for students. Therefore, this research aims to design and develop a web-based e-learning application system at SMK Paramarta. As a result, when a teacher is unable to attend, the teaching and learning process will be disrupted because there is no other media to deliver learning materials from the teacher to the students. The design of the Web-based E-learning Application System is built using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and CSS to beautify the e-learning pages that will be created. The web-based e-learning application system designed in this research can be an alternative modern and varied learning activity for students at SMK Paramarta. Additionally, this system can also assist teachers in providing learning materials and testing student understanding in a more effective and efficient manner. Therefore, it is hoped that the use of this system can improve the quality of education at SMK Paramarta. To ensure that the application runs smoothly, two testing phases are conducted: white-box testing and black-box testing on the data transfer process that runs within the e-learning application",

It evaluates instructional strategies, identifies challenges, and proposes solutions to improve technology implementation in teaching practices. \nStudy Design: A mixed-method approach was employed, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection. Interviews and observations provided insights into educators' experiences, while surveys measured the frequency and effectiveness of technology usage in instruction. \nPlace and Duration of Study: Conducted at the University of Eastern Philippines, Laoang Campus, during the 2024–2025 academic year. \nMethodology: Six mathematics teachers were selected through purposive sampling to ensure the inclusion of educators facing challenges in integrating technology into their teaching. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews and surveys, with thematic analysis applied to qualitative data and descriptive statistics used for quantitative responses. \nResults: Educators utilized diverse digital tools—including PowerPoint, GeoGebra, SPSS, HTML, Desmos, and PhotoMath to enhance lesson structure, data analysis, and interactive learning. Devices such as laptops, mobile phones, and smart TVs improved accessibility, yet challenges such as infrastructure limitations, digital literacy gaps, and student access disparities hinder full integration. Teachers addressed these barriers through strategic technology use, collaboration, and digital literacy initiatives. \nConclusion: While digital tools enhance mathematics instruction, infrastructure limitations, resource accessibility, and pedagogical constraints remain obstacles. Addressing these challenges requires sustained institutional support, improved digital infrastructure, and continuous professional development. By refining teaching strategies and fostering collaboration, educators can create inclusive and technology-driven learning environments that promote student engagement, comprehension, and academic success.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of targeted and computational pedagogical interventions on increasing the effectiveness of engineering education outcomes among U.S. students in agrarian communities. Such communities, traditionally characterized by a limited educational infrastructure, remoteness, and limited access to engineering material and resources, still grapple with how to equip students to transition into technical careers. Employing statistical modeling methods—such as regression analysis, factor analysis, and predictive analytics—we investigate the efficacy of customized instructional methods and technology HTML, C++ , and Python coding-based learning tools among a sample of rural schools. Interventions measured include adaptive digital platforms, assistive technology, real-world agricultural engineering case studies, and place-based, human-centered instructional design. The results indicate that students who are exposed to context-sensitive computational interventions exhibit quantifiable gains in conceptual understanding, engagement, and academic performance. The findings point to the potential of data-driven, regionally tailored models of education to close achievement gaps and build readiness in engineering among America's agrarian communities. Finally, the culture of how artificial intelligence is envisioned, created, and deployed can be radically changed when those from agricultural communities become enabled to study engineering—infusing practical, grounded viewpoints that challenge urban-centric assumptions of technical knowledge and allow for more integrated, context-aware AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Research spanning many decades has led to the identification,\n description, and analysis of misconceptions in biology and related\n disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, genetics, cell\n biology, physiology, and evolution. So-called “concept inventories” have\n been developed to identify common learner-held misconceptions of fundamental\n concepts in these disciplines. Testing with these inventories pre- and\n post-teaching is used, for example, to evaluate the effectiveness of\n pedagogical methods meant to address misconceptions by conceptual change at\n levels typically ranging from middle school to the undergraduate years.\n However, less studied are whether and which biomedical misconceptions are\n still held by learners who reach the undergraduate medical level and whether\n such misconceptions impede passing high-stakes exams that serve as\n gatekeepers between the preclinical and clinical years of medical education.\n Such persistent misconceptions might also impact clinical decision making\n and diagnosis, affecting patient outcomes. Several such studies have focused\n on physiology; less is known regarding the prevalence of cell biology\n misconceptions. Based anecdotally on grading of short essay responses on\n preclinical assessments to questions involving cell biology at our\n institution, I hypothesize that misconceptions persist into the preclinical\n years in some students. Preliminary analysis of multiple-choice question\n (MCQ) and similar short essay question response data recapitulates the\n common finding that the precise nature of misconceptions makes them\n difficult to detect unambiguously from MCQ responses alone. Individual\n concept inventory items used in exams when they match curricular content\n learning objectives are not always validated for such piecemeal use, making\n the detection of relevant misconceptions difficult in the context of an\n ongoing curriculum. Given the amount of content that medical learners are\n required to master in the relatively short time span of the preclinical\n years, it is difficult to address directly, such as with additional specific\n learning activities, misconceptions that were not corrected in the\n premedical undergraduate years. Thus, here, the objective was to review and\n assimilate literature to develop a framework and tools for assessing needs\n for conceptual changes within our integrated preclinical medical curriculum,\n specifically within cell biology domains in biomedical science.\n Supported by the UIWSOM Office of Research and Innovation\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acquiring knowledge and skills is a lifelong process for\n medical professionals, emphasizing constant self-update for better medical\n education & patient care (1). Teaching systems have evolved to enhance\n higher cognitive learning among undergraduates. Self-Directed Learning\n (SDL), introduced by Knowles in 1975, empowers students to diagnose learning\n needs, set goals, identify resources, & evaluate outcomes, inculcating\n curiosity, critical thinking, & problem-solving (2). However, SDL relies\n on student motivation & awareness which in turn are influenced by\n multiple other factors. The SRSSDL Tool evaluates readiness and identifies\n support areas which require support and shape themselves to adapt for better\n learning (3). This study assessed SDL’s efficacy and influencing factors\n among undergraduates. Methods: This study was performed on first-year\n medical students (n = 149) which was initiated four weeks before the\n session, with pre-reading materials shared two weeks earlier. The topic\n chosen for SDL was competency 4.1: \" Structure and Function of Digestive\n System \". On the session day, students were divided into 10 groups. The\n students were divided randomly and team members list was distributed along\n with the pre-reading materials. The individual (iRAT) and team (tRAT)\n readiness assurance tests were conducted for 10 minutes, followed by\n 10-minute discussion. Then teams addressed Short Answer Questions (SAQs) for\n 20 minutes, followed by 10 mins discussion. The groups created questions,\n exchanged, and solved them within 15 minutes, presenting their answers in\n another 15-minute discussion. The session concluded with a summary (10\n minutes). Attitudes and readiness were assessed using SRSSDL, followed by\n feedback (5-point Likert scale: audiovisual aids, teacher interaction,\n conduct of the session and session closure). The formative assessment was\n conducted after two weeks of SDL session, covering all topics taught during\n the preceding four weeks. Result: A total of 124 students (82.7%)\n participated in the SDL session. The iRAT and tRAT each comprised five\n questions, with mean scores of 4.8 and 5, respectively. Teams scored 83% on\n SAQs. Question framing was assessed based on objectivity, specificity, and\n cognitive load, scoring the mean score of 3.4 out of 5, while answers\n discussed scored 4.2 out of 5. The overall feedback is as follows: rating of\n 5 (68.05%), 4 (26.4%), 3 (3.15%) and 2 or 1 (2.4%). The positive correlation\n of feedback with components of SRSSDL tool (self-awareness, strategies and\n evaluation) is significant. A 1.5 fold improvement in formative assessment\n scores for SDL topics compared to traditional lectures highlighted the\n session’s efficacy. The components of SRSSDL tool (self-awareness,\n strategies and evaluation) is positively correlated with the scores in\n formative assessment. Conclusion: SDL effectively promotes engagement,\n better outcomes, and essential skills in first-year medical students. It\n fosters self-awareness, critical thinking, and collaboration, aligning with\n educational needs. Feedback confirms SDL's value in enhancing preparedness\n for self-guided learning. Integrating SDL with traditional methods in\n medical curricula can significantly improve student performance and\n readiness for the evolving demands of medical practice. References: 1.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, English has become an important subject of entrance examination for students, English directly decides the success or failure of the entrance examination. In order to facilitate the students for a long period of time to save English learning materials, notes, test results and other relevant information, timely understanding of the current situation of English learning and their own English level, do a summary to the present stage of English learning, a planning for English learning in the future. This paper adopts the ASP technology to build the English learning portfolio system, which provides the reference for the follow-up of software development. Mainly from five aspects of the ASP technology, the system architecture design, system module design, database design and system process design to build the system. Students through the system review previous learning materials, notes and test scores to reflect and evaluate their previous English learning situation, gradually forms a serious attitude of learning and an ability of independent learning. The research content of this article has important reference to improve the students' English level and the enthusiasm of English study.. Introduction Electronic learning portfolio is defined that in the information technology environment, the learners use information technology to perform and display that an aggregation of learning objectives, learning activities, learning outcomes and learning performance, learning pay, academic progress, and the study of reflecting on the learning process and learning result in the learning process [1]. It is mainly used to examine the achievements of students obtain through learning knowledge, the students can independently obtain the information of electronic learning portfolio such as learning outcomes, learning performance, according to the selected information to judge their own learning quality and progress. Language is an important tool for humans to communicate with others, also the basic conditions for humans to participate in social activities. In the modern life and the background of economic increasing globalization, English has become the most widely used international language in the field of human life , many countries and regions will take English as an important tool to interact with each other [2]. For students, English is a compulsory course for the basic education stage, which is also one of the major languages in foreign language courses [3]. In the present stage, because all the relevant information of students' English learning materials, exam papers and test scores are not preserved for a long time, it is not possible that students want to know at any time about the quality of English learning and their own English level at the present stage, students just blindly learn English and can not make a judgment for their own English learning situation , which is not conducive to the students' English learning. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes to establish electronic learning portfolio, using ASP technology to build English learning portfolio system. The system can preserve related information of the students' English learning materials, examination papers, test scores, which realizes the information management. Students can at any time obtain the wanted information, according to the selected information judge the quality of their own learning and progress. The system can help students to reflect and judge their previous English learning situation, gradually form a serious attitude of learning and the ability of independent learning, which has important significance to improve the students' English level and the enthusiasm of English learning. 3rd International Conference on Management, Education Technology and Sports Science (METSS 2016) © 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 513 ASP Technology ASP technology introduction: ASP technology is a kind of server scripting environment, it can be combined with HTML page, script commands and ActiveX components to create interactive Web pages and powerful applications based on Web [4]. ASP replaces the traditional CGI script, can interact with databases and other applications, which is one of simple programming tools of Microsoft research. ASP is mainly used to create dynamic WEB applications, web page file format is .asp, the web page includes images, script commands and plain text content, more common in the dynamic website, which is currently one of the most popular dynamic server page. Strong compatibility, which can achieve perfect compatibilities with many browsers, ensure the normal operation of the system in most browsers, improve the extensiveness of the application of the system. Secondly, through ASP technology create the system dynamic Webpage, which can realize real-time interactions between users and the system database, get the information what the users want, enhance the interactivity of the system. ASP mechanism: The ASP script is stored in the Web service in the form of .asp file. When the browser through the HTTP sends the service request command to the Web service, Web service calls the corresponding ASP file; ASP executable file asp.dll is responsible for reading the source code of the ASP page from the server, which is then parsed, find out the corresponding ASP script of the server and sent to the corresponding script engine to carry out; execution result will be combined with static HTML in the ASP Webpage and template text files together to generate a complete web page. This web page is a static web page, the server will send the web page to the client browser through HTTP, the operation mechanism is shown in Fig. 1 [5]. ASP adopts ActiveX technology which is developed by Microsoft, it is an important technical means of software research and development of Microsoft. It uses a technology of procedure calls and object encapsulation to reduce the complexity of programming, strengthen the relationship between the structure of the program. Some common components are encapsulated in ASP, many companies also have developed their own utility components. Software developers install these components on the server, through access to these components, who can quickly and easily build Web applications. ASP runs on a Web server, drastically strengthens the compatible between programming language which ASP uses and most browsers. ASP through the Web server returns the standard HTML page, the browser will parse it and then display to the user. Users view the page source files, what they see is just the ASP generated HTML page code, rather than the system itself written ASP program code, which effectively prevents leakage and loss of data, avoids the system source code to be copied. System Architecture Design In this paper, the design of English learning portfolio system architecture uses B/S architecture. B/S architecture is a kind of three layer system structure, it is based on C/S structure, which is a kind of improvement and upgrade architecture of C/S structure. C/S structure is a kind of two layer system structure based on distributed processing, through the rational allocation of tasks to the client and the server, which reduces the communication overhead of the system, it can make full use of the advantages of both ends of the hardware environment to reduce all kinds of bottleneck problem of computer system [6]. If the system uses the C/S architecture, the existence of the following several major problems: (1) the users before using the system have to install special client software, after Asp.dll HTTP Web service ASP file Client browser ASP script Script engine",

    "abstract": "Objective – Communication is essential to patient care. When serving Deaf patients, medical professionals who work with interpreters provide greater access to healthcare and wellness. Both the medical professional and the interpreter need training to develop the confidence and skills that support successful communication. This study aimed to introduce both Life Sciences and American Sign Language/English Interpreting undergraduate students to the experience of working together via role-play activities designed to promote effective communication with Deaf patients. Students from an Interpreting in the Healthcare Setting course were combined with students from an Endocrinology course to take part in this interdisciplinary assignment. Method – A group of three students per clinic completed each of the role play activities which were designed to simulate common interactions with medical professionals. The Life Science students enacted the role of the medical professional while one of the Interpreting students enacted the role of interpreter and the second enacted the role of a Deaf patient. Separate classrooms were designated as clinics where the role play was enacted. Clinics were designated as primary care intake, emergency department admissions, diabetes clinic and cardiac clinic. A mixed method approach was used to design both qualitative and quantitative questions on pre and post surveys distributed to 18 participants. The qualitative data was analyzed via collaborative review and categorized by theme. Quantitative Likert scale data was collected and analyzed to measure student preparedness, confidence and effectiveness of the activities. Results – The level of preparedness varied with each student and clinic type. All student participants from both courses reported increased confidence and ability when working with each other and with future Deaf patients. Conclusion – The study sought to create an authentic learning experience for undergraduate students who aspired to work in healthcare either as medical professionals or interpreters. By beginning such education earlier in students’ academic careers should result in more robust access to healthcare for Deaf patients. The model we created and evaluated can be used at all levels from community college through professional school to train Life Science students interested in health professions to provide equitable access to healthcare. For Interpreting students, the healthcare setting has a shortage of trained interpreters, and this model can provide them with the needed experience prior to working as interpreters in the healthcare setting.

    "abstract": "Glycemic control is a fundamental physiological concept in diabetes and obesity. Proper training of healthcare professionals in this content is essential for disease prevention and management. Active learning methods, including technology-mediated learning (TML), are important for effective education and student engagement. Given the complexity of physiology, educational technology can facilitate the visualization of its dynamic processes. Thus, we've developed the MeGli smartphone application as an educational tool to teach glycemic control and related conditions, aimed at undergraduate students in health and biological courses. Our hypothesis is that the use of MeGli in Physiology classes promotes student learning and satisfaction. MeGli ( https://t.ly/crEwT ) is a didactic simulator for glycemic metabolism, allowing users to observe postprandial and fasting events, interact with objects, and explore cellular processes. The aim of this study was to conduct and evaluate a TML class using the app and its impact on students' outcomes in Biological Sciences Physiology classes at University of Campinas (n = 23). We analyzed pretest-posttest knowledge questionnaires using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (p ≤ 0.05) due to non-normal data (Shapiro-Wilk normality test). Additionally, we applied a Likert scale opinion survey. Prior to the intervention, students provided informed consent, ensuring anonymous participation. The use of MeGli in a non-expository class, where students consulted the app in an active-learning process for answering and discussing questions, led to a significant improvement in their performance on the topic of glucose metabolism and diabetes (pretest mean 5,739± 0,3784 versus 8,652± 0,2142 on posttest; p < 0.0001). In terms of student feedback, opinion questionnaire results were overwhelmingly positive. All students agreed that the app was useful for learning and helped in their understanding of diabetes mechanisms. 87% understood the importance of healthy eating and physical exercise through the app. 91.3% reported a higher acquisition of knowledge due to the app's use and found the app-integrated class more stimulating and engaging. These findings strongly support the effectiveness of the MeGli application in facilitating physiology education, leading to a more motivating educational experience. Consequently, this study is significant in introducing an innovative tool that mediates active learning with technology, enhancing physiology teaching strategies and improving the education of future healthcare professionals.

In these articles, it was suggested more research is needed to understand the underlying phenomena to enhance understanding about why it is significant to continue expanding and sustaining educational tourism as a field of study and other scholarly activities that connect the world through global learning and travel quests. In this article, the purpose was to theorize connections between what appears to be divergent views between the ideas of tourism and global education. Inferring new understanding could serve to advance knowledge about the interrelationships among highly debatable and tentative theories about the value of educational tourism in higher education. Research shows that universities are central competitors in the global development of knowledge economy, alongside being significant contributors to the economic and social capital development of their host cities. The absolute number of universities now establishing international campuses abroad and online is evidence that universities are making a significant investment in the knowledge enterprises supported by educational tourism. Such partnerships make them more valuable as the largest suppliers of the human and intellectual capital on which the worldwide knowledge-based economy depends. This article shares knowledge about the role universities in helping faculty and students make connections between divergent disciplines and the interrelationships among highly debatable and tentative theories about the value of educational tourism to international education creativities (a.k.a. programs).

    "abstract": "Undergraduate career courses impact students’ STEM self-effcacy and identity, helping to close opportunity gaps by promoting retention and reducing the time to graduation. However, these courses are generally separate from students’ disciplinary courses, which allows students to see this work as important, but separate. In addition, this siloed approach means that only students who take these classes or engage with career services support individually have access to these opportunities. This opportunity gap is likely compounded for students from underrepresented and minoritized groups, creating a structural barrier where these students are expected to recognize the value and seek these opportunities in unfamiliar and often exclusionary environments. By integrating career exploration, skill development, and reflection into a student-centered biology classroom, we aim to engage students in purpose-driven exploration, planning, and skill development within the context of their disciplinary learning experiences. Drawing on the Social Cognitive Career Theory and Marcia’s Identity Formation Model we designed and assessed the IRL (In Real Life) lab curriculum, which was implemented in a student-centered introductory biology class that includes lecture and lab components. Through the IRL lab, students engaged in activities that helped in (a) Identifying and articulating their purpose, which we define as the intersection of their values, interests, skills, and the societal impact they prioritize in their work (b) Purpose-driven exploration and planning and (c) Making meaning of their experiences by building and articulating career-related skills, and building professional networks. We evaluated the outcomes using a qualitative coding approach, triangulating data from class assignments, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews to assess the impacts of the IRL lab on students’ STEM career identity and sense of belonging. We find that engaging with the IRL lab: (a) Increases students’ career-related self-effcacy and outcome expectations, thus impacting their STEM career identity (b) Shifts their focus from a destination-driven approach (specific job or career) to a purpose-driven approach, thus impacting their identity formation process and (c) Increases access and students’ sense of belonging by engaging them in making meaning of their disciplinary experiences and reflecting on how their academic goals align with their career goals. To summarize, STEM higher education is a choose your own adventure challenge where only some participants are equipped with the tools needed to navigate this new world. Engaging in career-related exploration and reflection in a disciplinary, student-centered class breaks down this structural barrier by equipping all students with the tools and strategies needed for success, thus empowering ALL students to choose their own adventure.

    "abstract": "Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an educational framework to guide the design of learning environments that are both accessible and challenging. The UDL follows three principles: Multiple means of engagement, multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression Lessons plan using UDL anticipates various learning styles, different interests, academic backgrounds, disability status, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Constructivism is a learner-centered theory of learning in which the instructor is considered a facilitator. In social constructivism, learning is facilitated through interactions with peers and instructors who can guide and support learning. Team-based learning (TBL) is an example of social constructivism. In this session, participants will learn how to implement the various stages of TBL for Biomedical Sciences that could be easily translated into other disciplines. Michelsen & Sweet introduced the essential elements of TBL as a guide for instructors to implement this approach in higher education courses. The main goal of TBL is \"ensuring that students have the opportunity to practice course concepts to solve a problem.\" The model presented by Michelsen consists of 5-7 learning modules that follow three-step cycles: 1) preparation step (pre-class). This step was created as \"flipped\" classroom with a variety of learning methods, assessments and virtual labs with immediate feedback to facilitate preparedness for step two 2) Step two is class readiness assurance; in this step, students take a two-step quiz process. First, students complete a quiz individually and submit their answers in scantron form. Subsequently, students re-take the quiz using the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique (IF-AT) as a team. Afterwards, students can challenge any questions they may have missed. Then, the instructor spends the last 10-15 minutes of the class for a short lecture to clarify misconceptions and review the questions. The readiness assurance portion lasts between 45-75 minutes. Finally, 3) step 3 is called \"Application of Course Concepts,\" in which application assignments are given to the teams. This period takes 1-4 hours, and thus, the most significant component of TBL is application. We hypothesize that flipped TBL can be effectively used as a UDL for undergraduate and graduate physiology courses. Undergraduate and graduate students report better understanding of concepts, engagement, and inclusion after participating on a TBL course. Conclusion: Flipped TBL is a powerful and effective teaching strategy to create an inclusive environment in physiology courses.

The act does not stipulate what intellectual independence is or how universities are to develop it. This article explores what intellectual independence might mean in the context of student learning in New Zealand, and what is known about how it could be developed and about how university teachers might confirm that they are developing it. The article provides a conceptual commentary and a model of intellectual independence, designed to encourage debate on this important and pressing higher-education policy issue. The model proposes that intellectual independence is the consequence of students learning the skills and dispositions to think critically, as an independent guide to their own beliefs and actions, and that the Education Act provides a challenge to higher education to contribute positively to the further development of an intellectually-independent critical citizenry.",

    "abstract": "The research is clear: micro and nanoplastics have been found throughout\n the human body, even in placentas, meconium, and semen. Microplastic\n exposures in animal and cell culture models have been associated with\n increased inflammation, activation of cancerous pathways, altered immune\n function and more. While awareness of the plastic pollution problem has\n improved, education on the biological interactions of these environmental\n pollutants, particularly as they pertain to human health, needs to be\n implemented. To better educate students about this topic, we created a\n presentation and lab experiment to share with middle and high school\n classrooms. The presentation begins with a competitive Kahoot pre-test,\n where we assess baseline knowledge of the audience. Following this, we\n provide an overview of plastic production, explanation of microplastics, and\n a summary of current research on the potential health effects of\n microplastics. Then, the students engage in an interactive lab, where they\n extract their own cheek cells, submerge those cells in a premade aqueous\n mixture of microplastics and observe the interactions of the cells and\n microplastics. The presentation finishes with a competitive Kahoot post-test\n and a culminating survey. We anticipate that our presentation will engage\n and excite groups of 7th-12th graders to become more environmentally aware\n and active and will measure this through a Likert scale survey. By recording\n the responses in the pre- and post-tests and surveying the students after\n the presentation, we expect to assess the effectiveness of the learning and\n overall interest. Ultimately, the goal is to share an easy-to-implement\n activity with the scientific community that can increase awareness in middle\n and high school students about the effects of microplastic pollution.\n Simultaneously, we aim to empower the next generation of scientists and\n researchers to communicate what they have learned and brainstorm solutions\n to this urgent environmental and health problem.\n Rutgers Interdisciplinary Research Teams NSF Grant 2203934\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

This approach may lead to students'\n confusion and limit their comprehension. This study aims to unfold the\n common logical steps of how these disturbances should be understood and\n analyzed without leaving any gaps in logic. These steps form a systematic\n framework applicable to analyze each type of disturbance and encompasses\n more clinical correlations, thus appropriate for medical students. Research\n Questions: 1. What is the logic in the systematic framework? 2. How\n effective is the systematic framework in facilitating the teaching and\n learning of the topic? Methods: We conducted a literature review to assess\n the coverage of body fluid disturbances in physiology textbooks and\n identified deficiencies in current teaching of the topic. We then reasoned\n out (unfolded) the temporal sequence (step-by-step) in the development of\n each type of disturbance from the cause(s) to the final consequences and\n what parameter(s) may change concurrently from each step. Results: 1. From\n the cause(s) to the final outcome of each type of disturbance, the following\n logic is unfolded: a. Check the extracellular fluid volume (ECF) to examine\n what is/are the primary changes (whether the volume change in ECF is\n accompanied by the osmolarity change in ECF? If yes, water shifts across the\n cell membrane results) b. Check the direction of water shift (from ECF to\n ICF, or vice versa?) as the secondary change. This step is crucial for\n students to understand each type of disturbance and should not be omitted.\n c. Check the tertiary changes as concurrent results of water shift including\n intracellular fluid (ICF) volume and osmolarity, hematocrit (increase or\n decrease), and the plasma protein concentration and the resulting colloid\n osmotic pressure. 2. The application of the systematic framework in our\n teaching has proved its effectiveness and completeness in understanding the\n topic. The omission of the secondary change in educational resources causes\n difficulties in students' learning. An analysis of the tertiary changes\n expands the teaching to encompass more clinical correlations caused by these\n disturbances. A newly developed flowchart in our poster will show the\n details of how the application of the systematic framework fills the gaps\n and provides a cohesive framework for teaching the topic. Conclusions: The\n development and application of the systematic framework to teach the body\n fluid disturbances advances physiology education by bridging the gaps and\n expanding the clinical correlations for medical students. The framework\n provides a solid foundation for students to learn renal physiology and\n pathophysiology including water and electrolyte balances and imbalances, and\n ultimately fosters critical thinking in clinical contexts.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Objective: We sought to increase engagement, reduce cognitive load, and foster self-directed learning while potentially improving exam performance by incorporating a social annotation tool (SAT) into a flipped classroom setting in an undergraduate medical education curriculum. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that using the SAT (Perusall) as preparatory material for a flipped classroom would increase engagement and academic performance compared to using a pre-recorded lecture video when teaching cardiovascular physiology. Methods: Within a first-year undergraduate medical physiology course, students (n=125) used the SAT to annotate assigned cardiovascular physiology readings before a flipped classroom session. This strategy was compared to the common practice of providing students with a pre-recorded lecture. Students took an assessment before and after to assess knowledge acquisition and engagement with both formats. Results: The SAT intervention identified an average time spent engaged with the material of 142.1 minutes ( n=125), with a pre- and post-assessment score improvement of approximately 20.25% (61.5% vs 82%; n=81). The pre-recorded one-hour lecture found that students engaged with the material, on average, for 51.45 minutes, corresponding to an average of 91% video completion. Findings from this lecture intervention showed the pre- and post-assessment scores improved by an average of 5% (71% vs. 76%; n=80). A paired sample t-test identified a significant difference between the percent improvement between quizzes for SAT (M=19.71, SD=26.374) and percent improvement for recorded lecture (M=6.57, SD=26.369); [t(69)=3.450, p=0.001]. The use of SAT enhanced academic performance in midterm and final exams. The average performance in questions that mapped back to the flipped classroom utilizing SAT text was 91% (n=6) , as compared to an average performance of 73% to those questions that mapped back to the online pre-recorded lecture (n=11 ). Conclusions: Incorporating SATs into a flipped classroom model increased engagement and academic performance versus passive lectures when teaching medical physiology.

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to science education is the widespread presence of misconceptions, which are persistent and generalized ideas that do not coincide with scientific knowledge, therefore becoming a major obstacle in the students' learning process. Biophysics is an essential interdisciplinary area in Physiology courses, but misconceptions tend to become more complex since several concepts need to be accessed for the subject to be understood. Therefore, this work aims to identify students' misconceptions about membrane physiology and use them to develop teaching strategies for undergraduate and graduate students. To do so, we used materials from interventions proposed to identify misconceptions and subsequent proposals of teaching strategies. Interventions were analyzed by the Committee for Ethics in Research on Human Beings (CEPSH-ICB/USP), approved under protocols 53043121.7.0000.5467 and 53059321.0.0000.5467. So far, surveys of students' misconceptions of various courses have been carried out, i.e., Veterinary Medicine, Biomedicine, students in a short extension course provided by the University of São Paulo, and graduate students. A survey is applied at the beginning of the courses, containing a series of statements about membrane physiology. Some of these statements are in line with the scientific context and others are common misconceptions among students. Students must respond whether they agree or disagree with the statements, following the Likert scale. Based on these statements, we created four clustering of difficulties, namely:- Related to the concept of transport;- Related to the structures that mediate transport;- Related to the moving forces of transport phenomena;- Related to general physiological (or biological) concepts.Throughout the disciplines, students receive individualized feedback on the classifications of difficulties found in their answers. At the end of the classes, students respond to a correction survey, where they can indicate whether they wish to change previously provided answers. With this data, it is possible to measure which topics were properly learned and which still require attention.It is possible to notice that the students demonstrate difficulties in applying the knowledge about ions in more complex contexts in which moving forces must be considered to determine the flow of these ions. Intervention analyzes showed that students have more difficulty in content involving the structures of channels and transporters, as well as reasoning about the moving forces of transport phenomena across the membrane, however, at the end of classes, they have less difficulty in topics associated with structures, but many misconceptions related to moving forces remain. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention to these topics while teaching biophysics to improve students' understanding.

    "abstract": "Medical laboratory scientists routinely evaluate blood smears in the clinical laboratory. A high level of skill in white blood cell morphology is required to do the task quickly and accurately. Educational approaches to teaching white blood cell morphology consist of showing examples of cells to students and allowing them to practice using trial and error to hone their skills. Student progress with this traditional approach is often quite slow. In order to expedite the learning process, we created a series of questions that can guide morphological identification; these questions focus on the shape and description of the nucleus, cytoplasm, granules and cell overall. We hypothesized that white blood cells can be accurately and uniformly identified using the criteria we’ve outlined. We confirmed the accuracy of this approach to white blood cell identification using a random forest classifier algorithm on a data set of 3600 cells that we had previously categorized. Our approach has the potential to standardize white blood cell morphology training in undergraduate medical laboratory scientist programs, and could help improve the consistency of manual differential results between hospital laboratories.

There is very serious research going on to find the reliability and capability of the LLM tools in assessing the students' exams. The evaluation process of the lab exams is a time consuming and sensitive task, particularly that involves a programming component in it. A team of researchers from University of Technology and Applied Sciences study the capabilities of both human and ChatGPT in evaluating the lab exam of Web Development course which involves HTML coding part in it. The team involved 22 students, who completed an 11-hour training in web development and conducted a lab exam for them. A clearly defined rubric was prepared for the evaluation purpose of this exam. Each student answer file was evaluated by 3 people, human, ChatGPT with Zero-Shot Learning (No rubrics) and ChatGPT with One-Shot Learning using a common rubric. Fleiss' Kappa calculation is used to measure the agreement among the evaluators. It is observed that the Fleiss' Kappa score is 0.506, indicating moderate agreement among Assessors. Still, this can be considered as a relatively high agreement among the raters, at the same time there is room for achieving higher agreement among the raters. Overall, the study concludes that when the assessment is based on the correct answer, the difference in evaluation is less compared to the partial and incorrect answers.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle physiology is often taught through didactic lectures\n with limited practical hands-on sessions. Consequently, it can be\n challenging for students to visualize and understand the cellular and\n molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction as illustrated in textbooks.\n Thus, active learning strategies are warranted to further enhance student\n teaching and learning. This study aimed to identify and summarize active\n learning (classroom) techniques for teaching skeletal muscle contraction. We\n performed a literature search on the Advances in Physiology Education\n website using these keywords: “skeletal muscle contraction,\" \"teaching,\" and\n \"models\". Our search identified 21 articles published in English between\n 1998 and present that used a wide variety of techniques for teaching\n skeletal muscle contraction. From the 21 articles identified, the primary\n teaching strategies consisted of physical models (n=9), laboratory\n activities (n=6), skits (n=3), games (n=2), and computer simulations (n=2).\n The majority of articles reported using these strategies among undergraduate\n students (n=19) with some use among graduate students (n=3) and high\n school/community college students (n=2) as well. Regarding the disciplines\n in which these strategies were deployed, nearly all of the articles reported\n their use in teaching exercise science (n=12) and anatomy and physiology\n (n=8). In 13 of the articles, student perceptions were assessed through a\n survey at the conclusion of the activity. Collectively, data from the survey\n responses indicated that students perceived that they 1) were more\n interested and actively engaged in the learning process and 2) acquired a\n better understanding of concepts and were more satisfied with the classroom\n experience. In conclusion, there are a variety of active learning techniques\n for teaching skeletal muscle contraction to high school and college\n students. Hence, educators who teach skeletal muscle contraction may find\n that these strategies reinforce and extend upon their lecture material to\n further enhance student engagement, learning, and/or satisfaction. Future\n work is needed to confirm that these specific activities translate to\n enhanced student learning.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "College English is a foreign language curriculum, strengthen the inspection information construction is the key to improve the students' English comprehensive ability. In order to quickly and easily test students' English learning situation for a period of time, realize English inspection information, designed on the online examination system of college English, lay the foundation for software development. The system mainly carries on development technology introduction, summary design, design of system process and database table design. Among them, summary design designs function of each module in detail; design of system process designs complete process of system procedure in detail; database table design designs associated table structure in database in detail. The research contents of this thesis have important significance to improve the quality of English learning and the students' English level etc. Introduction College English is a basic language courses, college English has two contents, one is the college English class for non-English major students, the other one is to lay a foundation for nature, to achieve the \"College English Syllabus\" four level requirements for the purpose of opening a basic English course [1]. The organization of traditional examination way generally have to go through the steps: manual, paper design, printing test paper, the examination room arrangement, examinee examination, examination paper collection, artificial volume change, performance reporting, results announced and exam evaluation etc. This will undoubtedly cause a great waste of manpower, material and financial resources and time, and work intensity, low efficiency, the students also feel bound and passive [2]. Errors may also be in the marking process, affect the test results. With the reform unceasingly thorough, the traditional examination way more and more can not meet the actual needs, and the online examination system based on campus network can break through the traditional way of examination to make examinations more flexible, but also can save a lot of time, manpower, material and financial resources, improve test efficiency and standard level [3,4]. In order to improve the English teaching quality and students' English level, realize English inspection information, designed on the online examination system of college English, lay the foundation for software development. Development Technology Introduction Based on the design of online examination system, this paper chooses the database for SQL server. Database design, interface design use the development language for ASP. NET. First of all, ASP. NET it is mainly used to create dynamic WEB applications. The compatibility is strong, it can not only be compatible with C, C#, can be compatible with many browsers, it ensures that the online examination system can run in many browsers, do not have to worry about compatibility issues, it also enhances the universality of the online examination system applications. ASP.NET sometimes also can be used as a programming language, associated with the ACTIVEX component, ASP command, HTML Webpage technologies to create an application based on WEB [5]. Secondly, ASP.NET is some code encapsulated in the control, through the JIT technology will translate the intermediate language into code, can be faster to invoke the WEB page, it also enhances the flexibility of the application of online examination system. International Conference on Education, Management and Computing Technology (ICEMCT 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 305 Summary Design Summary design is the next step to be analyzed, the main task is to get the DFD needs analysis converting software architecture [6]. Summary design usually use configuration diagram to depict a functional configuration of the software, the purpose is to ensure that based on the realization of logic model, as far as possible to improve the target system simplicity, variability, consistency, integrity, reliability, economy, efficiency and safety of operation. A structure diagram of the system shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the name of the top level with a system of \"college English online examination system\" means. The second layer is divided into \"students\", \"teachers\" and \"Administrator\" three kinds of users, each represents a module. The third layer with specific functions of each module, where \"students\" user functions include online answer, extract papers, submit papers, query results; \"teachers\" user functions include mark papers, bank management, performance management, papers analysis; \"administrator\" user management functions, including teachers management, students management, system maintenance, system backup. In each module, the definition of each specific function has its specific meaning. For example, in \"students\" module, online answer says students after a successful login according to random distribution questions in the question database to answer, in a specified time, complete answer, submit questions; in \"teachers\" module, bank management says teachers can add, modify and delete test information, randomly distribute questions of question bank to the online test students; in \"administrator\" module, system backup says administrator makes a backup of data of system-generated student achievement, to prevent data loss. Design of System Process The system process can be depicted by flow chart of the system. The flow chart of the system is the traditional tools of drawing system physical model, expressing the flow of components of the system, rather than the control process of information processing [7]. The system is divided into students, teachers, administrators of three users, the user to students as an example to illustrate the process of the design of system process, as shown in Fig. 2. System process design description: After the user starts the application, enter the login screen, when a user logs on to the system, the system prompts the user whether the account; if there is, the user is prompted to enter a user name and password; if not, the user is prompted to register account, after successful registration, re entering the login interface, input the registered user name and password. If the input is correct, enter the main interface, the user can select function, performs the required operation; otherwise, enter again, until you enter the correct user name and password, may Online examination system of college English Students Administrator Teachers O nline answ er Etract ppers Subm it ppers Q ery rsults Prform ance B nk m aagem nt M rk ppers Techers m aagem nt Stdents m aagem nt Sstem m ainnance Sstem bckup Ppers anlysis Fig. 1.

    "abstract": "In today’s rapidly evolving education landscape, educators—especially in underserved and resource-limited\ncommunities—face increasing challenges in providing timely and personalized feedback due to large class sizes and heavy\nworkloads. Traditional manual grading methods are time-consuming and often inconsistent, hindering individualized support\nthat is vital for student growth. This project, GRADIA AI – An AI-Powered Teacher Assistant, addresses these challenges by\nautomating the grading process and generating personalized feedback for students. The system leverages Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Computer Vision to evaluate both\nhandwritten and digital student submissions. It provides detailed, constructive feedback aligned with each learner’s needs,\nenabling teachers to focus more on mentorship and less on repetitive evaluation tasks. The solution integrates multiple tools and\ntechnologies to ensure efficiency and scalability. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling an\ninteractive user interface for teachers and students. The backend is powered by Python Flask, a lightweight web framework used\nfor managing requests, APIs, and database interactions. Gemini AI API and Google Vision API are employed for intelligent\ngrading, feedback generation, and text extraction from scanned exam papers. MongoDB serves as the primary database for\nstoring user details, assignments, grades, and feedback, while Google Cloud Services provide reliable hosting, storage, and AI\nprocessing capabilities",

    "abstract": "Critical thinking skills are one of the skills needed in the current era of education. The ability to think critically is an important key for students in successful problem solving. This research aims to develop an ethnoscience-integrated Electronic Student Worksheets (E-LKPD) for acid-base learning to enhance students' critical thinking skills. The Research & Development (R&D) 4-D model, developed by Thiagarajan, was utilized. The research subjects were 11th-grade students of Science at SMAN 1 Cigugur, in the academic year 2022/2023. The E-LKPD was designed in HTML 5 format, accessible online through smartphones and laptops. The material presentation in the introductory activities was contextual, incorporating ethnoscience content related to local phenomena, enabling students to understand and explore the connection between these phenomena and acid-base concepts. The validation results by expert validators showed a high validity rate of 92%. The assessment of student responses through questionnaires yielded scores of 87.2% in the small-scale trial and 89.4% in the large-scale trial, indicating that the E-LKPD was highly practical. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ethnoscience-integrated E-LKPD in enhancing critical thinking skills, pre-tests and post-tests were conducted. The N-gain value of 0.71 indicated a high improvement in students' critical thinking skills. The findings demonstrate that the developed E-LKPD integrated with ethnoscience effectively enhances students' critical thinking abilities. This is because the Ethnoscience Integrated E-LKPD media can connect learning in the classroom with the real experiences of students in everyday life, so that it can help students to develop critical thinking skills in the process.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized medical education, yet its specific effcacy in teaching medical physiology remains underexplored. Conveying the complexities of physiological responses to hypoxia through traditional teaching methods poses logistical challenges, potentially hindering students’ deep understanding. This study investigates the impact of incorporating VR into pre-clinical medical physiology teaching, focusing on students’ self-reported 1) knowledge acquisition and understanding of body responses to hypoxia, 2) VR technology acceptance and satisfaction, and 3) overall learning experience. Methods: In 2022, an ANU Medical School teaching enhancement grant funded data collection to develop a comprehensive storyboard for a VR hypoxia simulation program. With support from the school’s Technology-enhanced Learning and Teaching team and the university’s Centre for Learning and Teaching, we created an in-house limited prototype focusing on key aspects of the scripted VR simulation program to test its feasibility and perceived usefulness within our MCHD program. The tool was integrated into a year 1 practical session, followed by a two-part series of data collection, comprising a questionnaire and video interviews. The questionnaire used a mixed-methods approach, including 5-point Likert scale closed-ended questions rating VR perceived usefulness and ease of use, and open-ended questions allowing participants to provide qualitative responses. Interviews delved deeper into users’ experience, interactivity, collaboration, realism, practicality, knowledge acquisition, improvement suggestions, and overall technology and learning satisfaction. Results: Although the implemented intervention did not represent the full range of features envisioned for the final program, preliminary findings from the first round of data collection via questionnaires (n=45/96) reported positive user experiences. Sixty percent of responses showed agreement (agree (n=22) and strongly agree (n=5)) that learning outcomes were clear and aided by VR. Qualitative findings revealed higher motivation to use VR for learning and an intuitive interface. Thematic analysis identified improvement opportunities, including enhancing hypoxia symptom discernibility and refining visual resolution. These insights will inform the next study phase, refining features to improve the overall learning experience and address technical challenges. Conclusion: Grounded in constructivist learning theory and technology acceptance frameworks, our findings leverage realistic VR simulations to enhance knowledge acquisition and understanding of complex physiological responses. We express gratitude to the hypoxia simulation development project team (Dr Katie Freund, Yili Peng, Dr Siddarth Iyer, Dr Benjamin Mead, Prof Kevin Saliba and Dr Suzanne Estaphan) for their exceptional contributions.

    "abstract": "The growing enrollment of international students in doctoral science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs in the U.S. has contributed to the need for an increase in specifically-designed programs, resources, and services that address the unique challenges of the international student population. When transitioning to the U.S. to pursue higher education, international students often experience obstacles, including language barriers, sociocultural challenges, and academic alienation, which significantly impacts the ability to successfully adapt to the new learning and living environment, oftentimes continuing throughout the duration of the program. Furthermore, international postdoctoral fellows engaged in STEM research fields may lack a sense of belonging due to similar barriers. The recruitment and retention of competitive international students and postdoctoral fellows directly impacts the quality and magnitude of research outcomes, while also enhancing and enriching the cultural diversity and experience of the graduate community. We use data collected from an international student and postdoctoral survey distributed to more than 65 students and 90 postdoctoral fellows as well as listening sessions to identify gap areas where additional resources are required and where modifications are needed to more productively serve the international population at Augusta University. Our findings indicate that international students and postdoctoral fellows experience more anxiety and isolation when they are not supported, personally, socially and academically, by their administrative leaders, faculty, peers, and surrounding community. Incoming students who were connected with current graduate students prior to their arrival to the U.S. experienced a greater level of support and were more confident and comfortable in their adjustment to society in the U.S. The implementation of additional events and experiences led by the responses of the international population, including research shadowing opportunities in on-campus laboratories, social gatherings connecting students and postdoctoral fellows of different cultures, writing circles and professional development workshops, and one-on-one sessions enhances community belonging and prioritizes personal and professional growth among this vulnerable student population.
