    "abstract": "The development of IT&C technology, from \"e\" to \"m\" and \"i\" in the digital era has been the major challenge for both the modernization of the training and teaching process and for the management and scientific research of this process. The infrastructure of Collaborative Support Systems for Education (Document management systems, Process Management Systems, Conferencing tools, Recording/streaming tools, Virtual workspaces, Workflow systems, Web design tools, Meeting room technologies, Learning systems(organizational learning, educational tool, etc.), Development tools) and their main architectural modules recommends these systems as a technical solution capable of contributing to the solution of the complex issues found in education. This paper covers the main architectural and functional modules of a proposed Collaborative Support System (CSS, Integrated University Information System), based on Web technologies as well as the current usage scenarios in the university environment. It also deals with an evaluation of the impact of this system on specific activities of the education process in universities, the management of this complex process and an estimation of future usage scenarios for these systems in cloud computing. The structure and functions of this CSS are the following: WebBoard - software systems for creating and managing timetables, course assignments, physical room management; StudyCentral - training content specific to subjects found in the curricula, organized according to schools, study years, subjects, that contains teaching material in digital form (curricula, courses, case study and project books, self-testing collections, examination tests);i-Click - a virtual interactive environment used to track the conveyance of information, testing and managing student activities and attendance during the semester for all subjects in the curricula; LearnBase - Integrated information system used to manage the whole teaching process, which includes: student databases, grade management, student transcripts, statistics; CloudSpace - Cloud-based service that allows document and project sharing and real-time collaboration between students and teachers in an online environment.",

The study involved a sample of 743 candidates from 50 examination centers. The findings revealed weak positive correlations between practical coursework and practical examination scores for the Database and Programming components, but a negative correlation for Wed Design. The study also found that mean scores for coursework were significantly higher than those for practical examinations, which was attributed to factors such as the absence of scoring guides, undue assistance to students, and the unilateral assignment of marks by teachers. The research recommended capacity development workshops for teachers on item setting and marking, as well as the distribution of clear guidelines for coursework and practical examinations to all the Computer Science centers.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within educational frameworks, particularly in disciplines such as web design and development, represents a significant evolution in pedagogical strategies. This article examines a unique educational setup where students, while engaging in a web design class, utilize AI tools for text, image, and code creation within a simulated real-world scenario involving a client—dubbed \"Chef Cookie Cutter\". This simulated client interaction introduces unpredictability through mid-assignment requirement changes, thereby mimicking the dynamic nature of real-world web development projects. The focus of this case study is the critical role of human-in-the-loop (HITL) engagement in AI-assisted assignments, where students' adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving skills are put to the test. Such engagement not only prepares students for the intricacies and challenges of their future professions but also emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI-driven processes. By incorporating generative AI, video avatars, and personalized learning mechanisms, this educational approach fosters a rich, interactive learning environment that enhances digital pedagogy. The findings suggest that integrating HITL in AI assignments significantly improves learning outcomes by fostering an adaptive learning environment that closely mirrors the complexities and demands of the industry, thereby preparing students more effectively for their future careers.",

This paper analyzes these problems with a proposed solution through Visual WebBits, a web-based platform designed to help students solve the hurdles of web design. With essential web development languages, code snippets highlighting design tutorials are provided. Intended for the use of the College of Computing and Information Technology, CCIT, the platform aims to facilitate instruction and learning by systematically providing learning materials on a single platform. It features a brief alignment with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) standards, which aims to enhance students' competencies, honing them into globally competitive industry professionals. The platform comes with a great amount of code snippets focused on design, tutorials, and real-time previews, which makes learning and development interactive, allowing students to digest lessons more easily. It also comes with personalized educator tools that will enable professors to make custom exercises, accurately track student progress, and conveniently present lessons for lectures. Visual WebBits thus supports both teaching and learning by organizing the educational resources needed. The system supports students and educators in the most user-friendly manner, from a live code editor to educational exercises to make the environment of web development more efficient and engaging. In conclusion, the initiative offers a scaled solution in which users are equipped with effective resources to optimize the web design process while improving their technical competencies.",

Changing the teaching model is undoubtedly one of the best ways to improve the quality of secondary vocational education. In this paper, we use Citespace to analyze the teaching model in the past fifteen years, and predict that the blended teaching model will become a popular teaching model according to the hot spot analysis map and keyword clustering map. Then, we carry on the teaching design to the course of the \"Web design and production\", and apply it in the secondary vocational schools. Practice has proved that the blended teaching model can significantly improve students' academic performance.",

    "abstract": "Accessibility, in the context of computer science, is about making computing products accessible to people with disabilities. This means designing hardware and software products that can be used effectively by people who have difficulty reading a computer screen, hearing computer prompts, or controlling the keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. Thus, accessibility topics should be woven into any course about human-facing applications or websites, such as app and web design/development, software engineering, and human-computer interaction. In addition, accessibility is about creating technical solutions to accessibility problems that people with disabilities encounter in everyday living. These technical solutions may include the use of artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, or other CS topics. Thus, accessibility topics can be included in technical courses, particularly those that incorporate projects where students attempt to solve accessibility problems using techniques taught in the course. There are practical, intellectual, and social reasons to integrate accessibility into computer science curriculum. From a practical standpoint, employers increasingly include accessibility knowledge in job descriptions because they want their products and services to be accessible to more customers and for legal compliance. From an intellectual standpoint, technical solutions to many accessibility problems often require creativity and a multi-disciplinary approach that includes understanding user needs integrated with technical knowledge. From a social standpoint, accessibility is an important topic in addressing inclusivity and an attractive topic for those students who enter the field to do social good, leading to a broader mix of students in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, and ability. In this paper we define more technically what accessibility and disability mean, enumerate the major technologies that disabled people use for accessibility, discuss the accessibility standards used throughout the world, discuss the importance of accessibility research, and give advice on what accessibility topics can be used in several computer science courses. Throughout the paper we list some resources that teachers can use to add accessibility to their courses and to make their courses more accessible to disabled students.",

    "abstract": "This project focused on Artificial Intelligent (AI) and a chatbot represents machine that answers questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and allows the user to start a conversation with the machine. This paper presents the intelligent learning system for first aid called ILFA bot that aims to create intelligent virtual human agents to serve the role of online first aid guide for students. The research only covers the topic of First aid and the modules in ILFA website are Home, About Us, Contact and Video. The topics covers in First Aid are burns and scalds, bleedings, bone fractures, poisoning and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This web is a responsive web. Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approaches that creating a dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. The different this web to other learning website is student can communicate with our bot namely ILFA to ask about First Aid. The students will be able to learn about the First Aid in an interactive way with all the information video and if there are any further inquiries, they can communicate with the ILFA Bot.The architecture that use in this research is 3-tiers technology and a waterfall model as a methodology in this project. To test the function of ILFA bot, the researcher uses Black Box testing. The testing is based on chatterbox challenge and questions. The result from testing shows that ILFA Bot get 358 out of 500 points, 24% from the points is full mark from overall question.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of multimedia web design in education has drawn the interest of instructors in the modern learning process, the role of gender in such a process has not yet explored properly. The purpose of this research is therefore to evaluate the effects of gender on learners’ achievements when studying from the proposed platform. Therefore, multimedia courseware was built at the very early stage. Then, the students were divided based on their gender into two groups (male and female). The learning performance of each group gets compared using t-test. Result showed that no significant difference occurs between the two groups. This means that the proposed design is equally fitting the learners of both genders. In addition, the result obtained has shown that gender has no effect on learners' output. In conclusion, this study provides a guideline for the design of multimedia courseware. It contributes to the theories of gender and learning to come up with a clear understanding of the type of design elements that can be used for positive learning experience.",

    "abstract": "Di masa kini, teknologi berkembang dengan sangat cepat, terutama teknologi informasi, dan memengaruhi banyak aspek kehidupan, termasuk pendidikan. RA Sabulussalam adalah lembaga pendidikan Islam yang berlokasi di Kampung Sri Purnomo, Kecamatan Kalirejo, Kabupaten Lampung Tengah. Selama ini, lembaga ini membantu sistem penyimpanan data yang masih berupa kertas dan buku, yang membuat dokumen kurang aman dan terjamin penyimpanannya. Salah satu masalah yang muncul dengan metode ini adalah seringnya kehilangan buku tabungan karena buku-buku kecil itu mudah sobek dan kotor. Untuk merancang buku-buku yang lebih besar, lembaga ini harus menggunakan Diagaram Arus Data (DAD), Diagaram Konteks, dan Diagaram Arus Data (DFD), serta Flowchart adalah komponen sistem yang digunakan untuk menggambarkan model sistem SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Selanjutnya, desain web dilakukan dengan menggunakan Macromedia Dreamweaver, Xampp, web browser, dan Photoshop. Hasil penelitian berikut menunjukkan bahwa proses menabung siswa saat transaksi berlangsung dan pencetakan laporan, serta proses penarikan atau setor uang siswa saat transaksi berlangsung dan pencetakan laporan. Kelemahan sistem ini termasuk masalah teknis seperti tampilan data tidak fullscreen pada smartphone Android.\nNowadays, technology is developing very rapidly, especially information technology, and affects many aspects of life, including education. RA Sabulussalam is an Islamic educational institution located in Kampung Sri Purnomo, Kalirejo District, Central Lampung Regency. So far, this institution has helped the data storage system which is still in the form of paper and books, which makes documents less safe and secure in storage. One of the problems that arises with this method is the frequent loss of savings books because the small books are easily torn and dirty. To design larger books, this institution must use Data Flow Diagrams (DAD), Context Diagrams, and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), and Flowcharts are system components used to describe the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) system model. Furthermore, web design is done using Macromedia Dreamweaver, Xampp, web browsers, and Photoshop. The following research results show that the process of saving students during transactions and printing reports, as well as the process of withdrawing or depositing student money during transactions and printing reports. The weaknesses of this system include technical problems such as the data display is not fullscreen on Android smartphones.",

    "abstract": "We are pleased to present the first Special Issue on the International Web for All Conference (W4A) series featured in the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS) journal. This volume presents seven articles that are extended versions of the conference papers presented at the 18th International Web for All Conference, which was held online on April 19–20, 2021. Authors of several top papers from the conference submitted manuscripts for consideration, which then underwent a full journal review process. The guest editors for this issue are Victoria Yaneva (National Board of Medical Examiners, USA; University of Wolverhampton, UK) and Dragan Ahmetovic (University of Milan, Italy). The guest editors thank the authors for their excellent submissions, and they also thank all of the journal reviewers who contributed their time and expertise to this process. The first article, titled “AccessComics2: Understanding the User Experience of an Accessible Comic Book Reader for Blind People with Textual Sound Effects,” proposes an accessible digital comic-book reader for people with visual impairments. Surveys and interviews with participants who are blind or have low vision revealed preference for the inclusion of brief scene descriptions and sound effects. These components were integrated into the system and further evaluated, showing that the presence of scene descriptions was useful for concentration and understanding, while the sound effects made the book reading experience more immersive and realistic. The second article, “The Transparency of Automatic Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools: Design Criteria, State of the Art, and User Perception,” presents a comprehensive survey of the instruments available for automated website accessibility evaluation, the metrics they adopt, and how these are presented to the user. Through a survey with 138 users of evaluation tools and a study with 18 accessibility and web design experts, the authors identify a number of design criteria aimed to support the transparency of the reported results and their interpretability by end-users. The third article, “The Accessibility of Data Visualizations on the Web for Screen Reader Users: Practices and Experiences during COVID-19,” explores the level of accessibility of web-based data visualizations by screen reader users. To this end, the authors conduct an accessibility audit of 87 data visualizations by 3 expert auditors, a follow-up survey with 127 screen reader users, and an observational study with 12 participants interacting with accessible web visualizations. A final discussion proposes recommendations for designing more accessible data visualizations. The fourth article, “WordMelodies: Supporting the Acquisition of Literacy Skills by Children with Visual Impairment through a Mobile App,” presents a mobile app designed to support inclusive teaching of literacy skills for primary school students. The app includes over 80 different exercise types in Italian and English with adjustable difficulty levels. Evaluation with primary",

    "abstract": "Kelly is a senior majoring in finance at Smith University with one more semester left to go. After a graduation audit, she was told she has five more courses she needs to take: Business Strategy (MGT 490), International Finance (FIN 358), one service-learning course, and any two finance elective courses. A servicelearning course is a requirement at the university that has a community service component. Many of the service-learning courses are offered by the Computer Information Systems Department, and Kelly would like to take one of those. In particular, two courses she finds interesting are Intergenerational Computing (CIS 102T), which involves teaching senior citizens how to use the computer, and Web Design for Nonprofit Organizations (CIS 102W). After looking at the finance course offerings, she noticed four potential finance elective courses: Data Analysis in Finance (FIN 325); Risk Management (FIN 352); Options, Futures, and Swaps (FIN 356); and Fixed Instruments and Markets (FIN 359). Kelly would like to avoid morning classes because her internship requires her to work a few hours most weekday mornings. As she makes up her schedule, Kelly would like to keep in mind her priorities. Her priorities are first, the content of the course, second, the reputation of the instructor, and third, the timing of the course. She decided she will assign a rating between 1 and 5 to each course section under consideration. From the online class schedule, she has made a list of course sections offered, as shown in Table 1. All of the courses have at least two sections. Some sections meet once a week for three hours, and some meet twice a week alternating between one-hour and two-hour periods. An “hour” at Smith University is 55 minutes long. Rating the course sections, Kelly took into account three factors: content, instructor, and timing. The rating is the weighted average of the three factor ratings. She rated the content of the course based on her interest in it, using a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (extremely interested). The reputation of the instructor is also a value from 1 to 5, coming from published student comments (http://www.ratemyprofessors.com) and word of mouth from classmates. The timing of the course is also a number from 1 to 5, and takes into account things such as the times that most of the senior class gets together in the common rooms to watch shows such as Glee, The Walking Dead, and The Big Bang Theory. Kelly wonders how to use this information to obtain a good schedule.",

In different variations, this teaching method was tested on students of Cultural Sciences and Architecture in Brazil and in Germany. With this method, even students without previous CAD or architecture experience can creatively design spaces. Visualization of the design process as Web design joins the individual aspects to a logical composite and applies the computer as “brain-craft” to complement handcraft. For the creative tasks, this means interaction in a complex information structure where the borders between the disciplines fade.",

This book looks at how discovery systems are actually used by examining the findings of several user experience (UX) studies, providing data and observations that will inform your decisions about selecting, implementing, and enhancing this software.\n This book provides library practitioners who choose, administer, and interact with discovery systems with insight for establishing or fine-tuning a discovery system. You will understand how the use and effectiveness of the top discovery systems compare to more traditional databases and web resources, get insight into the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the best-selling discovery systems, and examine the UX research findings of the authors on student response and faculty response. You'll also learn about key configuration options that help or hinder search success with these systems and affect content selection, linking software setup, and interlibrary loan processes. The book concludes with recommended best practices for promoting discovery systems, including web design, placement on the library's website, getting coworkers on board, and PR ideas.",

    "abstract": "Beginning in July 2021, Political Science instructors at Pellissippi State Community College began the process of transitioning from commercially published textbooks to Open Educational Resources (OERs) in its introductory courses. The project is part of a statewide initiative led by the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) to increase equity in access to quality, no/low-cost educational materials. The overarching goal is to increase success rates and improve educational outcomes for traditionally underserved students, such as but not limited to students of color, first-generation college students, and economically disadvantaged students. Pellissippi State has traditionally been the largest community college in the state of Tennessee and its enrollment population is made of both traditional and non-traditional students from every race and socio-economic income level. However, data collected prior to this transition has revealed lower completion and retention rates among minorities. A research team at Pellissippi State Community College was awarded two separate grants by TBR to conduct these transitions. This presentation will consist of two parts. The first part summarizes the process of transitioning the Introduction to American Government course to an OER textbook created by OpenStax, along with adopting and creating additional open access materials during the 2021-2022 academic year. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed from a total of 14 sections of the course to determine the impact of the transition. The second part will chronicle ongoing efforts of an inter-departmental team – consisting of faculty from Political Science, Media Technologies and Web Design, and Librarian Services – to create an Open Access Publication for the Introduction to Political Science course. Although this project will be in process during the conference, a summary of the work to date will be provided.",

This study aims to investigate the impact of Web Design (WD) on customers Repurchase Intention (RI) and to evaluate whether E-Satisfaction (ES) serves as a mediator in this relationship.\nMethods: The research employed a quantitative approach, utilizing purposive sampling to gather data sourced from 124 students from several colleges in Semarang. It conducted a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis using SmartPLS.\nResult: The findings of this research show that Web Design (WD) has a significant and positive effect on Repurchase Intention (RI). Additionally, E-Satisfaction (ES) positively influences Repurchase Intention (RI) and serves as a mediator for the beneficial impact of Web Design (WD) on Repurchase Intention (RI).\nNovelty: The findings of this study provide recommendations for Bukalapak to enhance its Web Design (WD) and ensure high levels of user E-Satisfaction (ES). These strategies can help boost user interest in making repeat purchases on the Bukalapak platform. The novelty in this study lies in the use of diverse range of objects and research methods that are different from previous studies.",
