    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within educational frameworks, particularly in disciplines such as web design and development, represents a significant evolution in pedagogical strategies. This article examines a unique educational setup where students, while engaging in a web design class, utilize AI tools for text, image, and code creation within a simulated real-world scenario involving a client—dubbed \"Chef Cookie Cutter\". This simulated client interaction introduces unpredictability through mid-assignment requirement changes, thereby mimicking the dynamic nature of real-world web development projects. The focus of this case study is the critical role of human-in-the-loop (HITL) engagement in AI-assisted assignments, where students' adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving skills are put to the test. Such engagement not only prepares students for the intricacies and challenges of their future professions but also emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI-driven processes. By incorporating generative AI, video avatars, and personalized learning mechanisms, this educational approach fosters a rich, interactive learning environment that enhances digital pedagogy. The findings suggest that integrating HITL in AI assignments significantly improves learning outcomes by fostering an adaptive learning environment that closely mirrors the complexities and demands of the industry, thereby preparing students more effectively for their future careers.",

RhoArchitecture is an approach for designing and executing JSON-DSLs, incorporating a modular programming model, a JSON-based evaluation engine, and an integrated web development environment. This paper presents RestRho, a RESTful NodeJS server developed using two JSON-DSLs designed with RhoArchitecture: SQLRho and DBRestRho. These languages enable declarative specification of database operations and HTTP requests, respectively, supporting modularity, reuse, and template-based transformations. We validate the RestRho implementation through a dual approach. First, we apply software metrics to assess code quality, maintainability, and complexity. Second, we conduct an empirical study involving 39 final-year computer engineering students, who completed 18 structured tasks and provided feedback via questionnaires. The results demonstrate the tool’s usability, development efficiency, and potential for adoption in web application development.",

    "abstract": "With the rise in enrollment in computing programs, online learning offers the flexibility to scale up enrollment. To help students succeed in an online course, evidence-based engagement strategies need to be incorporated and evaluated for their effectiveness in increasing student engagement, which is a key determinant of student learning outcomes. This also addresses a concern with online learning, where students often feel detached and disengaged. In this innovative practice full paper, we describe our implementation of a study group strategy that we employed to increase students' engagement across different online formats of an upper-level computing course. Study groups are intended to allow students to discuss course concepts, foster social-emotional engagement, and provide positive learning experiences rather than being dependent on group members to complete a task or receive a grade. Although the strategy has been implemented in face-to-face computing courses, it has not been implemented and evaluated in different online formats of a computing course. The primary contribution of this study is the empirical evidence of the impact of study groups on students' learning outcome and engagement across the online formats of the course. The context of this study is an upper-level web-development course offered in different online formats, including online asynchronous in Spring 2020, online asynchronous and online hybrid in Fall 2020, and online synchronous in Spring 2021, where the study group strategy was employed. Three semesters of data collection were conducted using questionnaires administered at the beginning and end of the courses. Students learning outcomes and engagement were not significantly different between the different online course formats, allowing us to compare across the courses. Findings indicate that a study group strategy has a positive relationship with participation engagement in all of the online course formats. However, study groups may not directly influence learning outcomes. A study group strategy may improve learning outcomes in an online environment if the instructor facilitates the study group's work. This study has implications for utilizing study groups in different online formats of upper-level computing courses.",

Conducting such tests requires preparing a location for the test, spending time on checking and notifying students. Currently, there are a large number of different ways to monitor and evaluate knowledge. A tool for measuring a student's achievements is a properly designed test that corresponds not only to the subject of study, but also to its tasks and serves to develop a systematic approach to studying the discipline. Testing in educational institutions is used as a means of objective control of students' knowledge of the curriculum. Systematic monitoring of students' level of knowledge, on the one hand, determines the student's academic performance, and on the other hand, it is an indicator of the effectiveness of teaching methods and organization of the educational process. The inclusion of various forms of test tasks in the learning process motivates students to step up work on mastering educational material and forms a desire to develop their abilities. Comparing the testing performed with the help of paper questionnaires and online testing, it is obvious that online testing is much more effective.\n\nThe computer models of web-based knowledge verification services have been investigated in this paper by using methods of statistical and computer modeling. The research of knowledge control methods has been carried out and it has been shown that the time required to create a test and analyze the results in the perspective system could be minimized by using the modern technologies in the field of web development. The choice of the system architecture and a specific set of technologies depends on the requirement of maximizing speed of the system-user interaction. The analytical component of the system should answer the users’ most popular questions concerning the test results. The results obtained provide the main characteristics for creating a computer model of a web service for testing knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Web applications are increasingly the main way to create user interfaces, and they are often the most common software beginners have encountered. However, web development relies on concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies, which are challenges beyond the scope of an introductory course. Additionally, many features of modern web frameworks conflict with CS1 principles, such as avoiding global mutable state and promoting test-driven development. Consequently, web development is rarely integrated into CS1 courses, despite its motivational potential. This paper introduces Drafter, a new open-source Python library for CS1, enabling students to develop full-stack web applications using pure functions with minimal boilerplate. Drafter has simple functions to generate HTML, eliminating the need to learn HTML or templating languages. The data model scales with students' mastery of types, from primitives to nested lists, Dataclasses, and dictionaries. Drafter supports unit testing of entire web applications and reinforces CS1 concepts like decomposition and reusability. Websites created with Drafter can be deployed through GitHub Pages, with plotting and image manipulation. Students receive extensive debug information, including unit test scaffolding, program state visualization, and enhanced error messages and tests. This paper discusses the pedagogical features and design decisions behind Drafter, along with instructor reflections on its use. We believe Drafter can significantly enhance student engagement in CS1 courses and reinforce key learning objectives.",

    "abstract": "The “T multi-layer architecture” refers to the three-tier application architecture commonly used in web development, which consists of the presentation layer (client), application logic layer (middle tier), and data access layer (server). This architecture extends the traditional client/server model by introducing a dedicated application server layer to handle business logic, thereby separating user interface functions from data processing. The term “T” metaphorically represents the structural division among these layers, enabling modular management and load balancing. The client-server interaction follows a three-tier model: the client layer handles user interface communication, the application server layer processes business logic, and the data layer manages database operations. This separation allows the application server to share processing loads, addressing the overburden issue in traditional C/S architectures. The middle tier acts as a bridge, ensuring seamless data flow between the client and server. The 30% increase in student engagement was measured via dual methods (1) automated tracking of platform interactions (e.g., number of case studies accessed, quiz attempts, and discussion forum contributions): and (2) a 5-point Likert scale survey administered mid-course and at completion. For the 80% understanding improvement, students completed pre-and post-course concept mapping exercises focused on complex cost topics (e.g., bill of quantities valuation), with evaluators blind-coded to assess map complexity and accuracy. On average, students spend approximately 2 hours per week engaging with course content on the ECTP. A survey of students rated the user interface with a high ease-of-use score of 4.5. Furthermore, 70% of students noted significant improvements in their problem-solving abilities after using the platform. Project cost information management involves complex logic and lengthy processes. An efficient cost information system is essential to manage these workflows and standardize business procedures. The adaptive learning-based ECTP was designed with this goal in mind, integrating fragmented cost data for educational purposes.",

At Universitas Darma Persada, the career center faced challenges in disseminating job vacancy information efficiently due to time constraints and limited distribution methods, primarily via Instagram. This study aims to design and develop a web-based job vacancy information system to improve accessibility and communication between job seekers and employers.The uniqueness of this research lies in the development of a role-based job portal system that integrates multiple user roles, namely job seekers (students and alumni), career staff, and employers, into a single digital platform. The objective is to accelerate job vacancy publication, facilitate job applications, and streamline employer access to candidate data.This study adopts the Waterfall methodology, including stages of requirement analysis, system design, implementation, and testing. Data were collected through observation, interviews, and literature review. The final system was developed using Visual Studio Code, PHP, MySQL, and other web development tools.The results show that the system successfully reduces delays in job vacancy announcements, expands reach beyond Instagram, and provides a more structured and interactive recruitment process. Employers can post jobs and review CVs, while job seekers can apply directly and track their application status. The system has proven effective in enhancing the career center’s role in graduate employability support.",

    "abstract": "\n Background : The use of new technologies and methodologies in young people’s mental health research is needed to allow more frequent and reliable sampling. Mobile applications and e-platforms create exciting potential for the collection of large-scale cohort data, however there are various feasibility and ethical issues to consider. Consultation with young people is needed to inform the research agenda, and ensure these technologies are engaging, useful and safe. This article describes the process of Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) with a sample of young people in London, with the aim of i) informing the development of a mood-monitoring e-platform, and ii) providing feedback and advice for researchers developing web-based technologies in the mental health field. Methods : A total of 26 young people were consulted across four advisory group sessions. All young people were students enrolled at one of the participating London based sixth form colleges, and voluntarily attended a workshop session. Audio recordings of the sessions were analysed using a theory driven thematic analysis framework. Results: Young people were generally receptive to e-health technologies and valued the opportunity to collaborate throughout the development process. The advisory groups identified key considerations for future web-development work to encourage engagement and prolonged use, including, the promotion of trust and transparency, consideration of accessibility, provision of support, production of engaging and functional design, and acknowledgment of specific contextual influences surrounding young people’s wellbeing. Conclusions : Involving young people in the development process of e-health technologies contributes to optimising the successful adoption and prolonged usage of new methodologies. The thematic map outlines can be used to inform researchers interested in developing web-based technologies in the mental health field and will be directly applicable to the development of a mood-monitoring e-platform.",

    "abstract": "The cloud storages are becoming expensive these days and can be expected to increase more and more. The cloud storages give certain amount of the storage and then start asking the users to pay for the subscription model. Using Microprocessors and web development, it can offer you a better solution to have a personalised Private cloud storage. A private cloud storage is a storage solution that is hosted on your own network, rather than on a third-party service. This means that your data is stored in a more secure location and you have more control over it. Microprocessors can be used to create a private storage and which will be only accessible to the particular users only. Microprocessors like raspberry pi and the hard drive like SD cards, HDDs are been used to make a private cloud storage.

To assist self-studies of novice students, we have developed the JavaScript-based web-client programming learning assistant system (JSPLAS). It offers various types of exercise problems with different learning goals, where any answer from a student is automatically marked in the system. In this paper, we present a design of the phrase fill-in-blank problem (PFP) in JSPLAS. A PFP instance provides a source code for web-client programming where several phrases are blanked out, and requests students to fill them in correctly. A phrase consists of one or multiple elements in the code. The correctness of any answer is verified through string matching with the original phrase. In future works, we will generate PFP instances for basic web-client programming concepts and assign them to students for comprehensive evaluations of the proposal. Besides, we will implement the automatic generation program of a new PFP instance to assist teachers.",

The current collection of academic data is felt to be less effective because it is still done manually. One of the superior features planned is an online report card system that allows academic staff and students to access the academic data needed for their respective needs. The method of collecting data in the preparation of this thesis is the method of observation, interviews and literature study. A web development method developed using the Code Igniter framework whose programming language is PHP based, Code Igniter applies the MVC (Model, View, Controller) concept which makes it easier for developers to design a website. By developing this academic application, it can make it easier for academic staff to manage academic data and student report card scores online, which will be very effective and efficient in terms of time and students can immediately see the results of their report card scores online by accessing This academic application is through a website that is opened using a browser.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring effective communication between students and academic administration is essential for a seamless and responsive educational experience. Despite this, many institutions continue to use outdated or informal methods for managing student complaints, leading to inefficiencies, a lack of accountability, and unresolved issues. This research paper introduces the development and implementation of a Student Review and Complaint System, a comprehensive web-based solution aimed at closing the communication gap between students and administrative bodies, particularly Heads of Departments (HODs). The system allows students to easily submit complaints or feedback about campus facilities, faculty behavior, academic issues, or general grievances through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Students can also attach images or media files to support their submissions, ensuring that complaints are well-documented and verifiable. On the administrative side, HODs and other authorized personnel have access to a secure dashboard to review, track, and respond to complaints promptly.\n\n\n The application is constructed using the MERN stack—MongoDB for database management, Express.js for backend API handling, React.js for a dynamic frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment. Security and privacy are prioritized through JWT-based authentication, enabling strict role-based access control to differentiate between student and admin functionalities. This paper further explores the system's technical architecture, development workflow, challenges faced during implementation, and the overall benefits of introducing such a digital complaint system in academic institutions. By automating the complaint process and maintaining a structured feedback loop, the system enhances transparency, improves responsiveness, and fosters accountability within educational environments.\n\nKeywords: Student Complaint System, Student Review Portal, MERN Stack, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, JWT Authentication, Role-Based Access Control, Web Development, Media Upload Feature, Academic Feedback, Educational Technology, Campus Issue Resolution, Admin Dashboard, Complaint Tracking System",

Great advances have been made in the application of computational geoprocessing tools, allowing the public to analyze and integrate data from several locations with the use of maps, allowing the user to personalize with their records and to share information, elaborating and disseminating their own to the public through Internet. In order to alleviate conflicting situations regarding the search of certain places and to strengthen the knowledge about the State University of Londrina, a website adapted to mobile devices was elaborated, using web development tools, with the aim of unifying the new media communication links with the informational technological growth with the University visibility and accessibility, while also increasing the integration between students and visitors of mediations, seeking to guide passers-by and the entire university community that move through this region in the city of Londrina. In addition, the project was developed based on public utility, in order to serve as a common and inherent use of people's daily life, thus stimulating the development of new proposals regarding collective well-being. \nKeywords: Knowledge.

    "abstract": "Student success is a growing concern in higher education institutions. How can educators create courses that better prepare students for their future careers? The purpose of this paper is to present recommendations that will assist educators in helping students to be successful in college. This paper begins by briefly discussing a service-learning project (SLP). Next, the paper compares the advantages and disadvantages of completing a simulated project against a service-learning project in a web development course from a teacher’s perspective. Additionally, this paper explores the students’ and clients’ perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of SLPs. This paper also outlines a model for teaching a web development course with the integration of a service-learning project. Finally, the paper concludes with the idea that community service-based projects can benefit all parties involved and should be considered when designing the pedagogy for an advanced web development course. This study, along with others referenced in the paper, finds that service-learning projects provide a framework for structuring an effective course curriculum.",

Although plenty of literature about developing these skills exists as stand-alone instruction, in this essay I present a bird’s-eye view of content production from an ethnomusicological perspective, providing an understanding of not only content production but how intersects with revenue and ethnomusicological goals.

The software is distributed both as native packages and specialized production containers.

Developers can change the source tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing development and testing of the system even when offline. They simplified the training and onboarding of new team members and summer interns. And they were useful in workshops where students could have first-hand experience with the mechanisms and components that, in production, run millions of jobs.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for flexible and self-paced learning in higher education has underscored the need for intelligent digital tools that support autonomous study, particularly in foundational technical domains such as web development. This study aims to design and implement an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to facilitate independent learning among undergraduate students in basic web development courses. The ITS was developed using the Laravel framework and integrated with a MySQL database, incorporating client-side and serverside programming components to deliver structured instructional content, interactive exercises, and automated feedback. A structured software development methodology, including requirements analysis, system design through use case and class diagrams, and iterative interface prototyping via Figma, guided the development process. The ITS was designed to supplement existing e-learning platforms and is intended to enhance accessibility, self-regulation, and learner engagement, particularly for students needing to review or retake the course material. Preliminary implementation results suggest that the system supports autonomous learning by providing modular course content, instructor-curated assessments, and a user-friendly interface. The platform also includes feedback mechanisms to continuously refine the instructional material based on learner input. The findings indicate that Intelligent Tutoring Systems have the potential to improve student outcomes by fostering independent learning habits and providing scalable instructional support in computer science education. This research contributes to the advancement of personalized e-learning technologies and offers a practical framework for ITS development in resource-constrained academic environments.",

Currently, the KRS process still utilizes a digital questionnaire in the form of a Google Form, which is less efficient and accurate. Therefore, the author constructs a web-based system using PHP Laravel, employing the Web Development Life Cycle (WDLC) approach. This web-based KRS system enables students to perform the KRS process online, access class schedules, and view the availability and quotas of subjects. Teachers and school administrators can efficiently manage and monitor the KRS process. This development is expected to provide benefits such as time and resource efficiency, data accuracy, ease of access, and an enhanced user experience in arranging schedules and selecting subjects.",

    "abstract": "Most CS1 classes are designed to teach programming and computational thinking using a specific programming language such as Python or Java. This type of in-depth study leaves little room for creative exploration by students. In particular, at large colleges and universities, the programming assignments are usually autograded to keep up with expanding enrollment. This lightning talk will introduce the idea that simply adding three creative labs that do not use the actual course material, but instead expose students to other computing concepts, can give the students who are struggling a chance to catch up, while also offering them a much-needed breather doing something in computing that is individually directed and creative. Over the last few years, my Teaching Assistants (TAs) and I have developed three simple web development labs as assignments for our large CS1 classes. These three labs are usually given around each of the exam weeks and provide a much-needed break for the students from the regular class material that continues to build upon prior learning. Many students report that the labs were their favorite part of the course because they were creative and self-directed. This lightning talk aims to gather feedback on this concept and assess its potential for integration into advanced CS courses. I'm also keen to hear suggestions for alternative labs in a CS1 class that would both introduce students to further CS principles and allow them to showcase their creativity.",
