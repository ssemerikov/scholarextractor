    "abstract": "The development of IT&C technology, from \"e\" to \"m\" and \"i\" in the digital era has been the major challenge for both the modernization of the training and teaching process and for the management and scientific research of this process. The infrastructure of Collaborative Support Systems for Education (Document management systems, Process Management Systems, Conferencing tools, Recording/streaming tools, Virtual workspaces, Workflow systems, Web design tools, Meeting room technologies, Learning systems(organizational learning, educational tool, etc.), Development tools) and their main architectural modules recommends these systems as a technical solution capable of contributing to the solution of the complex issues found in education. This paper covers the main architectural and functional modules of a proposed Collaborative Support System (CSS, Integrated University Information System), based on Web technologies as well as the current usage scenarios in the university environment. It also deals with an evaluation of the impact of this system on specific activities of the education process in universities, the management of this complex process and an estimation of future usage scenarios for these systems in cloud computing. The structure and functions of this CSS are the following: WebBoard - software systems for creating and managing timetables, course assignments, physical room management; StudyCentral - training content specific to subjects found in the curricula, organized according to schools, study years, subjects, that contains teaching material in digital form (curricula, courses, case study and project books, self-testing collections, examination tests);i-Click - a virtual interactive environment used to track the conveyance of information, testing and managing student activities and attendance during the semester for all subjects in the curricula; LearnBase - Integrated information system used to manage the whole teaching process, which includes: student databases, grade management, student transcripts, statistics; CloudSpace - Cloud-based service that allows document and project sharing and real-time collaboration between students and teachers in an online environment.",

The study involved a sample of 743 candidates from 50 examination centers. The findings revealed weak positive correlations between practical coursework and practical examination scores for the Database and Programming components, but a negative correlation for Wed Design. The study also found that mean scores for coursework were significantly higher than those for practical examinations, which was attributed to factors such as the absence of scoring guides, undue assistance to students, and the unilateral assignment of marks by teachers. The research recommended capacity development workshops for teachers on item setting and marking, as well as the distribution of clear guidelines for coursework and practical examinations to all the Computer Science centers.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within educational frameworks, particularly in disciplines such as web design and development, represents a significant evolution in pedagogical strategies. This article examines a unique educational setup where students, while engaging in a web design class, utilize AI tools for text, image, and code creation within a simulated real-world scenario involving a client—dubbed \"Chef Cookie Cutter\". This simulated client interaction introduces unpredictability through mid-assignment requirement changes, thereby mimicking the dynamic nature of real-world web development projects. The focus of this case study is the critical role of human-in-the-loop (HITL) engagement in AI-assisted assignments, where students' adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving skills are put to the test. Such engagement not only prepares students for the intricacies and challenges of their future professions but also emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI-driven processes. By incorporating generative AI, video avatars, and personalized learning mechanisms, this educational approach fosters a rich, interactive learning environment that enhances digital pedagogy. The findings suggest that integrating HITL in AI assignments significantly improves learning outcomes by fostering an adaptive learning environment that closely mirrors the complexities and demands of the industry, thereby preparing students more effectively for their future careers.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of web development is bringing many challenges to developers, particularly at the design level. Many developers struggle to build a stunning yet functionally successful website due to the overwhelming number of available frameworks and libraries. This paper analyzes these problems with a proposed solution through Visual WebBits, a web-based platform designed to help students solve the hurdles of web design. With essential web development languages, code snippets highlighting design tutorials are provided. Intended for the use of the College of Computing and Information Technology, CCIT, the platform aims to facilitate instruction and learning by systematically providing learning materials on a single platform. It features a brief alignment with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) standards, which aims to enhance students' competencies, honing them into globally competitive industry professionals. The platform comes with a great amount of code snippets focused on design, tutorials, and real-time previews, which makes learning and development interactive, allowing students to digest lessons more easily. It also comes with personalized educator tools that will enable professors to make custom exercises, accurately track student progress, and conveniently present lessons for lectures. Visual WebBits thus supports both teaching and learning by organizing the educational resources needed. The system supports students and educators in the most user-friendly manner, from a live code editor to educational exercises to make the environment of web development more efficient and engaging. In conclusion, the initiative offers a scaled solution in which users are equipped with effective resources to optimize the web design process while improving their technical competencies.",

Changing the teaching model is undoubtedly one of the best ways to improve the quality of secondary vocational education. In this paper, we use Citespace to analyze the teaching model in the past fifteen years, and predict that the blended teaching model will become a popular teaching model according to the hot spot analysis map and keyword clustering map. Then, we carry on the teaching design to the course of the \"Web design and production\", and apply it in the secondary vocational schools. Practice has proved that the blended teaching model can significantly improve students' academic performance.",

    "abstract": "Accessibility, in the context of computer science, is about making computing products accessible to people with disabilities. This means designing hardware and software products that can be used effectively by people who have difficulty reading a computer screen, hearing computer prompts, or controlling the keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. Thus, accessibility topics should be woven into any course about human-facing applications or websites, such as app and web design/development, software engineering, and human-computer interaction. In addition, accessibility is about creating technical solutions to accessibility problems that people with disabilities encounter in everyday living. These technical solutions may include the use of artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, or other CS topics. Thus, accessibility topics can be included in technical courses, particularly those that incorporate projects where students attempt to solve accessibility problems using techniques taught in the course. There are practical, intellectual, and social reasons to integrate accessibility into computer science curriculum. From a practical standpoint, employers increasingly include accessibility knowledge in job descriptions because they want their products and services to be accessible to more customers and for legal compliance. From an intellectual standpoint, technical solutions to many accessibility problems often require creativity and a multi-disciplinary approach that includes understanding user needs integrated with technical knowledge. From a social standpoint, accessibility is an important topic in addressing inclusivity and an attractive topic for those students who enter the field to do social good, leading to a broader mix of students in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, and ability. In this paper we define more technically what accessibility and disability mean, enumerate the major technologies that disabled people use for accessibility, discuss the accessibility standards used throughout the world, discuss the importance of accessibility research, and give advice on what accessibility topics can be used in several computer science courses. Throughout the paper we list some resources that teachers can use to add accessibility to their courses and to make their courses more accessible to disabled students.",

    "abstract": "This project focused on Artificial Intelligent (AI) and a chatbot represents machine that answers questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and allows the user to start a conversation with the machine. This paper presents the intelligent learning system for first aid called ILFA bot that aims to create intelligent virtual human agents to serve the role of online first aid guide for students. The research only covers the topic of First aid and the modules in ILFA website are Home, About Us, Contact and Video. The topics covers in First Aid are burns and scalds, bleedings, bone fractures, poisoning and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This web is a responsive web. Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approaches that creating a dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. The different this web to other learning website is student can communicate with our bot namely ILFA to ask about First Aid. The students will be able to learn about the First Aid in an interactive way with all the information video and if there are any further inquiries, they can communicate with the ILFA Bot.The architecture that use in this research is 3-tiers technology and a waterfall model as a methodology in this project. To test the function of ILFA bot, the researcher uses Black Box testing. The testing is based on chatterbox challenge and questions. The result from testing shows that ILFA Bot get 358 out of 500 points, 24% from the points is full mark from overall question.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of multimedia web design in education has drawn the interest of instructors in the modern learning process, the role of gender in such a process has not yet explored properly. The purpose of this research is therefore to evaluate the effects of gender on learners’ achievements when studying from the proposed platform. Therefore, multimedia courseware was built at the very early stage. Then, the students were divided based on their gender into two groups (male and female). The learning performance of each group gets compared using t-test. Result showed that no significant difference occurs between the two groups. This means that the proposed design is equally fitting the learners of both genders. In addition, the result obtained has shown that gender has no effect on learners' output. In conclusion, this study provides a guideline for the design of multimedia courseware. It contributes to the theories of gender and learning to come up with a clear understanding of the type of design elements that can be used for positive learning experience.",

    "abstract": "Di masa kini, teknologi berkembang dengan sangat cepat, terutama teknologi informasi, dan memengaruhi banyak aspek kehidupan, termasuk pendidikan. RA Sabulussalam adalah lembaga pendidikan Islam yang berlokasi di Kampung Sri Purnomo, Kecamatan Kalirejo, Kabupaten Lampung Tengah. Selama ini, lembaga ini membantu sistem penyimpanan data yang masih berupa kertas dan buku, yang membuat dokumen kurang aman dan terjamin penyimpanannya. Salah satu masalah yang muncul dengan metode ini adalah seringnya kehilangan buku tabungan karena buku-buku kecil itu mudah sobek dan kotor. Untuk merancang buku-buku yang lebih besar, lembaga ini harus menggunakan Diagaram Arus Data (DAD), Diagaram Konteks, dan Diagaram Arus Data (DFD), serta Flowchart adalah komponen sistem yang digunakan untuk menggambarkan model sistem SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Selanjutnya, desain web dilakukan dengan menggunakan Macromedia Dreamweaver, Xampp, web browser, dan Photoshop. Hasil penelitian berikut menunjukkan bahwa proses menabung siswa saat transaksi berlangsung dan pencetakan laporan, serta proses penarikan atau setor uang siswa saat transaksi berlangsung dan pencetakan laporan. Kelemahan sistem ini termasuk masalah teknis seperti tampilan data tidak fullscreen pada smartphone Android.\nNowadays, technology is developing very rapidly, especially information technology, and affects many aspects of life, including education. RA Sabulussalam is an Islamic educational institution located in Kampung Sri Purnomo, Kalirejo District, Central Lampung Regency. So far, this institution has helped the data storage system which is still in the form of paper and books, which makes documents less safe and secure in storage. One of the problems that arises with this method is the frequent loss of savings books because the small books are easily torn and dirty. To design larger books, this institution must use Data Flow Diagrams (DAD), Context Diagrams, and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), and Flowcharts are system components used to describe the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) system model. Furthermore, web design is done using Macromedia Dreamweaver, Xampp, web browsers, and Photoshop. The following research results show that the process of saving students during transactions and printing reports, as well as the process of withdrawing or depositing student money during transactions and printing reports. The weaknesses of this system include technical problems such as the data display is not fullscreen on Android smartphones.",

    "abstract": "We are pleased to present the first Special Issue on the International Web for All Conference (W4A) series featured in the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS) journal. This volume presents seven articles that are extended versions of the conference papers presented at the 18th International Web for All Conference, which was held online on April 19–20, 2021. Authors of several top papers from the conference submitted manuscripts for consideration, which then underwent a full journal review process. The guest editors for this issue are Victoria Yaneva (National Board of Medical Examiners, USA; University of Wolverhampton, UK) and Dragan Ahmetovic (University of Milan, Italy). The guest editors thank the authors for their excellent submissions, and they also thank all of the journal reviewers who contributed their time and expertise to this process. The first article, titled “AccessComics2: Understanding the User Experience of an Accessible Comic Book Reader for Blind People with Textual Sound Effects,” proposes an accessible digital comic-book reader for people with visual impairments. Surveys and interviews with participants who are blind or have low vision revealed preference for the inclusion of brief scene descriptions and sound effects. These components were integrated into the system and further evaluated, showing that the presence of scene descriptions was useful for concentration and understanding, while the sound effects made the book reading experience more immersive and realistic. The second article, “The Transparency of Automatic Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools: Design Criteria, State of the Art, and User Perception,” presents a comprehensive survey of the instruments available for automated website accessibility evaluation, the metrics they adopt, and how these are presented to the user. Through a survey with 138 users of evaluation tools and a study with 18 accessibility and web design experts, the authors identify a number of design criteria aimed to support the transparency of the reported results and their interpretability by end-users. The third article, “The Accessibility of Data Visualizations on the Web for Screen Reader Users: Practices and Experiences during COVID-19,” explores the level of accessibility of web-based data visualizations by screen reader users. To this end, the authors conduct an accessibility audit of 87 data visualizations by 3 expert auditors, a follow-up survey with 127 screen reader users, and an observational study with 12 participants interacting with accessible web visualizations. A final discussion proposes recommendations for designing more accessible data visualizations. The fourth article, “WordMelodies: Supporting the Acquisition of Literacy Skills by Children with Visual Impairment through a Mobile App,” presents a mobile app designed to support inclusive teaching of literacy skills for primary school students. The app includes over 80 different exercise types in Italian and English with adjustable difficulty levels. Evaluation with primary",

    "abstract": "Kelly is a senior majoring in finance at Smith University with one more semester left to go. After a graduation audit, she was told she has five more courses she needs to take: Business Strategy (MGT 490), International Finance (FIN 358), one service-learning course, and any two finance elective courses. A servicelearning course is a requirement at the university that has a community service component. Many of the service-learning courses are offered by the Computer Information Systems Department, and Kelly would like to take one of those. In particular, two courses she finds interesting are Intergenerational Computing (CIS 102T), which involves teaching senior citizens how to use the computer, and Web Design for Nonprofit Organizations (CIS 102W). After looking at the finance course offerings, she noticed four potential finance elective courses: Data Analysis in Finance (FIN 325); Risk Management (FIN 352); Options, Futures, and Swaps (FIN 356); and Fixed Instruments and Markets (FIN 359). Kelly would like to avoid morning classes because her internship requires her to work a few hours most weekday mornings. As she makes up her schedule, Kelly would like to keep in mind her priorities. Her priorities are first, the content of the course, second, the reputation of the instructor, and third, the timing of the course. She decided she will assign a rating between 1 and 5 to each course section under consideration. From the online class schedule, she has made a list of course sections offered, as shown in Table 1. All of the courses have at least two sections. Some sections meet once a week for three hours, and some meet twice a week alternating between one-hour and two-hour periods. An “hour” at Smith University is 55 minutes long. Rating the course sections, Kelly took into account three factors: content, instructor, and timing. The rating is the weighted average of the three factor ratings. She rated the content of the course based on her interest in it, using a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (extremely interested). The reputation of the instructor is also a value from 1 to 5, coming from published student comments (http://www.ratemyprofessors.com) and word of mouth from classmates. The timing of the course is also a number from 1 to 5, and takes into account things such as the times that most of the senior class gets together in the common rooms to watch shows such as Glee, The Walking Dead, and The Big Bang Theory. Kelly wonders how to use this information to obtain a good schedule.",

In different variations, this teaching method was tested on students of Cultural Sciences and Architecture in Brazil and in Germany. With this method, even students without previous CAD or architecture experience can creatively design spaces. Visualization of the design process as Web design joins the individual aspects to a logical composite and applies the computer as “brain-craft” to complement handcraft. For the creative tasks, this means interaction in a complex information structure where the borders between the disciplines fade.",

This book looks at how discovery systems are actually used by examining the findings of several user experience (UX) studies, providing data and observations that will inform your decisions about selecting, implementing, and enhancing this software.\n This book provides library practitioners who choose, administer, and interact with discovery systems with insight for establishing or fine-tuning a discovery system. You will understand how the use and effectiveness of the top discovery systems compare to more traditional databases and web resources, get insight into the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the best-selling discovery systems, and examine the UX research findings of the authors on student response and faculty response. You'll also learn about key configuration options that help or hinder search success with these systems and affect content selection, linking software setup, and interlibrary loan processes. The book concludes with recommended best practices for promoting discovery systems, including web design, placement on the library's website, getting coworkers on board, and PR ideas.",

    "abstract": "Beginning in July 2021, Political Science instructors at Pellissippi State Community College began the process of transitioning from commercially published textbooks to Open Educational Resources (OERs) in its introductory courses. The project is part of a statewide initiative led by the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) to increase equity in access to quality, no/low-cost educational materials. The overarching goal is to increase success rates and improve educational outcomes for traditionally underserved students, such as but not limited to students of color, first-generation college students, and economically disadvantaged students. Pellissippi State has traditionally been the largest community college in the state of Tennessee and its enrollment population is made of both traditional and non-traditional students from every race and socio-economic income level. However, data collected prior to this transition has revealed lower completion and retention rates among minorities. A research team at Pellissippi State Community College was awarded two separate grants by TBR to conduct these transitions. This presentation will consist of two parts. The first part summarizes the process of transitioning the Introduction to American Government course to an OER textbook created by OpenStax, along with adopting and creating additional open access materials during the 2021-2022 academic year. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed from a total of 14 sections of the course to determine the impact of the transition. The second part will chronicle ongoing efforts of an inter-departmental team – consisting of faculty from Political Science, Media Technologies and Web Design, and Librarian Services – to create an Open Access Publication for the Introduction to Political Science course. Although this project will be in process during the conference, a summary of the work to date will be provided.",

This study aims to investigate the impact of Web Design (WD) on customers Repurchase Intention (RI) and to evaluate whether E-Satisfaction (ES) serves as a mediator in this relationship.\nMethods: The research employed a quantitative approach, utilizing purposive sampling to gather data sourced from 124 students from several colleges in Semarang. It conducted a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis using SmartPLS.\nResult: The findings of this research show that Web Design (WD) has a significant and positive effect on Repurchase Intention (RI). Additionally, E-Satisfaction (ES) positively influences Repurchase Intention (RI) and serves as a mediator for the beneficial impact of Web Design (WD) on Repurchase Intention (RI).\nNovelty: The findings of this study provide recommendations for Bukalapak to enhance its Web Design (WD) and ensure high levels of user E-Satisfaction (ES). These strategies can help boost user interest in making repeat purchases on the Bukalapak platform. The novelty in this study lies in the use of diverse range of objects and research methods that are different from previous studies.",

This study aims to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability in job placement classification using advanced machine learning models and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Utilizing a dataset containing graduates’ academic records, including course grades, grade point average (GPA), and internship duration, this research employed several classification models, including decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), CatBoost, and logistic regression. Evaluation metrics showed that most models achieve 92% precision, 92% recall, and 92% F1 score, with an accuracy of 85%, while logistic regression excelled with 100% recall, 96% F1 score, and 92% accuracy. SHAP analysis identified key features such as Administration, Computer Organization, Information Systems, Entrepreneurship, Professional Ethics, and Web Programming as the most influential in predicting job placement. Other significant contributors include Introduction to Information Technology, Software Engineering II, and Data Mining, although with relatively lower influence. Extracurricular activities and internship experiences were also found to be influential factors, highlighting the importance of academic and nonacademic elements in shaping graduates’ career prospects. These findings highlight and emphasize the need to provide students with certain academic courses to better prepare them for the job market. These findings emphasize the importance of interpretable machine learning models in career forecasting, enabling educational institutions to optimize curriculum design and enhance graduates’ employability. Future research should explore feature selection techniques, temporal analysis, and personalized recommendation systems to refine predictive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Designing and delivering web application courses for computing undergraduates is a challenging task. Lack of understanding of web concepts affects the students” interest in web application development. Therefore., faculty employ several traditional strategies including hands on exercises and labs as well as innovative strategies such as videos and discussion forums. However., due to the volume of the posts in the forums., the instructors find it challenging to attend to the students' challenges and focus on more challenging topics across the classroom. In this paper., we propose a text mining based solution to extract the questions and complex topics. We evaluated the solution on the year 2 Web Application course offered to the computing undergraduates. Our experiments show that logistic regression model performs better in classifying question posts and cosine similarity performs better in assigning the topic label to the posts. The findings are visually depicted and are useful to the faculty to identify the topics that requires more attention to improve students' learning.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes and researches deeply the main problems existing in the teaching process of Web front-end courses based on the Internet mode.It also puts forward the theory knowledge system of Web 3.0 front-end course and the core idea of creating progressive online project case, thus changing the students' traditional learning methods and making the students change from theoretical memorizing learning to practical learning.And gradually reform the computer room offline teaching mode and examination mode, ensure that students master the latest related theories, technologies and tools of Web front-end courses as soon as possible, so that students can adapt to the needs of enterprises for Web front-end talents. 1. A Review of domestic and Foreign Research status 1.1 Relevant research on the theoretical knowledge system of Web front-end courses. In recent years, based on Internet + mode, around the Web front-end curriculum theory knowledge system reform and exploration of related research, from the current knowledge of literature, mainly focus on the teaching content, teaching mode and study on the corresponding talent training, etc.Such as The teaching reform and practice of Web front-end development technology course by Jiuliang Chu. Computer education,2014(14); Liqing Zeng’s Research on the front-end development framework of web application for web 2.0.Technology and innovation,2015(22) ; Research on the exploration and talent cultivation of Web front-end technology course content by Song Yang. information and computer (theory), 2016(11); Reflection on WEB programming course teaching by Liu Ni. Journal of guiyang college (natural science edition),2017(04) and other Scholars discuss the importance and necessity of the reform of the theoretical knowledge system of Web front-end courses from different perspectives. 1.2 Related research on project case teaching. Case teaching as a kind of teaching mode is widely applied in the system of higher education, especially those who have strong course requires students to practice is especially important in the teaching, at present scholars mainly focus on aspects such as case teaching, case selection and evaluation system for related research.Such as Jinghua Sun’s Application of case teaching method in Web programming teaching. Chinese science and technology information,2008(20);The practice and exploration of the reform of college classroom teaching mode by case teaching by Huarong Wang. Chinese university teaching,2011(04);Application of extensibility case in the teaching of Web application development technology by Huiling Guo. Journal of China environmental management cadre college,2013,23(01);Case driven Web technology and application teaching reform exploration by Dai Tao.China science and education innovation guide,2014(08).Web programming case driven teaching research by Dongmei Guo.Journal of anqing normal university (natural science edition),2016,22(01); and other Scholars discussed the concrete application of case teaching in teaching Web front-end, and also made the relevant beneficial research and exploration in the Web front-end course , Although the project case method is used for teaching, but most of the project cases are just off-line, can only be run in the computer room, lab, not directly to online (such as student write page, not able to run on the Server background, students' learning experience poor, low sense of achievement), and even if some schools have created a project case library website, just provide 183 Copyright © 2018, the Authors.

    "abstract": "Learning analytics has developed into a powerful tool for discovering unforeseen patterns in educational data and forecasting students' academic success. In order to anticipate the final exam grades of students studying software engineering, this study suggests a learning analytics framework based on machine learning algorithms, using component grades as the source data. The dataset included the academic performance grades of 1475 students who enrolled in a private university for a year to take a Java Web Programming course. To estimate the students' final test grades, the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms' performances―which are among the machine learning algorithms were calculated and compared. A multitude of features, including the assignment, practical exam, two progress test, two workshop, and final exam, were used to make the predictions. Such data-driven research is crucial for developing a framework for learning analytics in higher education and for influencing decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The Merdeka Curriculum brings significant changes to the approaches, strategies, methods, and models of learning. One of the most notable changes can be seen in the Informatics subject. The Algorithm and Programming material is part of the Informatics subject, emphasizing students' ability to develop an application. Unfortunately, SMA N 2 Pontianak faces limitations in computer availability, which hampers the learning process for the Algorithm and Programming material. Therefore, this research aims to develop a feasible learning media using the drill-and-practice approach to support learning activities for the Algorithm and Programming material at SMA N 2 Pontianak. Additionally, this study seeks to understand the responses from users after utilizing the developed learning media. The research method used is the Research and Development (R&D) method with the ADDIE approach. The instruments used include interview guidelines, questionnaires, and documents. The data analysis was conducted using descriptive qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results indicate that the drill-and-practice learning media for the Algorithm and Programming material is effective and appropriate for its intended purpose. \nKeywords: Development, Drill and Practice, Web, Programming Algorithms",

    "abstract": "The platform developed by the researcher, called the \"Code Simulator,\" covers web programming learning materials, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application, which integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages with a website-based code simulator, is a type of software designed to assist students in organizing and evaluating the programming materials taught by teachers through projects in a Project-Based Learning model. This study aims to determine the learning outcomes competency of students after using the Techcode application and applying the project-based learning model in web programming lessons. This research used a quantitative pretest-posttest method. The research design used is the ADDIE method with a prototype development model. The target of this research is students of class XI RPL at SMK PGRI 2 Sidoarjo. The instruments used include validation sheets for learning tools, pretest-posttest question validation sheets, material validation sheets, and question validation sheets. The research results show that the percentage of material validation was 92.5%, Rencana Pelaksanaan Pembelajaran (RPP) validation was 89%, pretest-posttest question validation was 90%, and media or learning tools validation was 95.5%. Based on the results of the T-test, the significance value obtained was <0.001, which means 0.001 < 0.05, so H₀ is rejected and H₁ is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of a website-based learning media can improve students' learning outcome competencies in learning web programming.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of digital technology requires vocational high school graduates to master practical competencies that align with current industrial needs. However, initial observations at SMK Negeri 2 Cimahi revealed that students in the Software Engineering department were still dependent on procedural programming and had very limited exposure to modern frameworks such as Laravel. This competence gap resulted in low readiness to face professional challenges in web development. To address this issue, a community service program was implemented in the form of a Laravel bootcamp that applied a project-based learning approach. The program involved 40 students who were guided through structured activities including technical preparation, introduction to Laravel concepts, project development of a To-Do List application, and comprehensive evaluation. The evaluation results demonstrated clear improvement, with the average pre-test score of 46.25 increasing to 72.80 in the post-test. Further analysis of competency achievement showed that 85% of participants understood the MVC concept, 90% successfully implemented CRUD functions, 80% mastered authentication, 75% presented projects effectively, and 88% demonstrated strong teamwork. These outcomes confirm that project-based bootcamps can effectively bridge the gap between theory and practice, while strengthening technical competence and enriching teaching resources available for schools and higher education institutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines students' perceptions and attitudes toward peer feedback within the course Introduction to Web Programming. The primary aim is to explore how students perceive the contribution of peer evaluation to the enhancement of their projects, the development of reflective thinking, and the strengthening of professional competencies. The research was conducted after the completion of student projects and the peer assessment phase, using a post-activity survey distributed to participating students. The survey was specifically designed to capture students' attitudes and experiences regarding various aspects of the peer feedback process. Responses were analyzed across several categories: technical correctness, visual quality, content relevance of feedback, presentation skills, emotional responses to feedback, sincerity, and reflective engagement. Findings indicate that students generally viewed both giving and receiving peer comments as useful for improving project quality and supporting personal development, especially in relation to evaluation and self-evaluation skills. Moreover, students reported that peer feedback contributed to their critical thinking, boosted self-confidence, and fostered more constructive academic communication. Based on these insights into student perspectives, the study proposes guidelines for the further implementation and improvement of peer assessment practices in technology-related educational settings.",

However, the selection process for the KIP-Kuliah scholarship faces challenges due to limited quotas and a high number of applicants. In developing this system, the author adopts a descriptive method to collect the necessary data and information. Meanwhile, for system design, the Waterfall method is utilized in a systematic and sequential manner, covering analysis, design, coding, and testing stages. The system design also incorporates the Unified Modeling Language (UML), including Use Case Diagrams  and Class Diagrams. The Decision Support System application is implemented using the PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) web programming language and a MySQL database. The results showed that development of this decision support system will assist the student affairs department in determining suitable scholarship recipients based on predefined criteria, thereby making the scholarship selection process more efficient and effective.",

The current problems of teaching web programming at school are considered, its main components are highlighted: HTML page layout, programming on the client and server sides. The analysis of existing services and online games for teaching web layout is presented. As a result of the analysis of the traffic of the studied services, an increased interest of Internet users in web simulators, implemented using the principles of gamification, was revealed. However, today there are a limited number of such services, in addition, many topics of web programming and layout are still unrealized with the help of such web simulators.The article describes a completed project of developing a web simulator for teaching the basic properties of CSS animation. When designing a web simulator, the requirements for the implementation of game mechanics and dynamics were considered, which will make it possible to organize the educational process in a dynamic, exciting and visual way. The article describes the key features of the web simulator, its functional requirements, provides a rationale for the choice of topics and design of the web simulator, and considers the algorithm of its operation. The topics that are studied as a result of passing tasks in the web simulator are listed. The risks associated with the implementation of the web simulator in the educational process are described.The authors carried out an experiment on the basis of an additional education institution \"KiberOne Programming School\" among 10th grade students, the results of the experiment showed the effectiveness of using the developed web simulator in teaching CSS animation.",

Research has explored the impact of anonymous engagement via social media on classroom dynamics, revealing that anonymity boosts student participation in both in-person and online sessions. This study concentrates on enhancing the quality of anonymous participation in classrooms and assessing its effect on less active students. Quality participation implies relevant discourse aligned with the subject. While anonymity increases student engagement, it can also lead to disruptions such as cyberbullying. Focusing on object-oriented and web programming university courses, we utilized the ANONI app for data collection, proposing a method to enhance the quality of anonymous engagement. Our approach yielded positive outcomes, with just two instances of off-topic activities, notably fewer than previous studies.",

    "abstract": "The e-Iearning system or distance learning system has become important, especially during the COVID-19 pan-demic. Several tertiary institutions have made the e-Iearning system an alternative teaching and learning activity. Research on the use of e-Iearning needs to be explored to obtain innovative, creative, and fun learning. One aspect that can be examined in e-learning is students' emotional response to the learning activities. The emotional state of students directly or indirectly affects the learning process. The student's emotional responses can be measured by their facial expressions. In this study, an exploration was carried out on the facial expressions shown by students in HSS Learning, an e-Iearning for learning web programming. The student's facial expressions were extracted using 68 pairs of facial landmarks and additional 6 facial feature vectors. The total number of features used is 142. Machine learning methods for classification are applied to determine the performance of several classification models, including the k-Nearest Neighbor (k- NN) algorithm, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Machine learning performance evaluation is done using the Fl-score and confusion matrix. The results show that the accuracy of the k-NN, Logistic Regression, and SVM are 91.4%, 92.2%, and 92.1 %, respectively. However, the Fl-score macro values are relatively low due to data imbalance with the k- NN, Logistic Regression, and SVM models are 0.250, 0.272, and 0.243, respectively. While the study provides insight into the student learning experience in e-Iearning settings, this study needs to be explored more.",

    "abstract": ": In the digital era, the existence of a website for a university study program is important. With a website that can be accessed anywhere and at any time, the public can find out information and everything related to the study program. The Jambi University Indonesian Literature Study Program website has been designed by the team with the page https://sastraindonesia.unja.ac.id. However, the website is not managed well so the information presented has not been updated. Apart from that, the layout of the site is also irregular, thereby reducing public interest in accessing the website. In fact, through the study program website you can disseminate information such as profiles, vision and mission, organizational structure, scholarships, student achievements, questionnaires, and news content and other information. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the Indonesian Literature Study Program website at Jambi University as a medium of information for the public. This website management activity begins with the stages of analyzing website needs, collecting website data, designing and filling content, and socializing the website to the public. The result of this service activity is website governance Jambi University's Indonesian Literature Study Program is getting better. This can be seen from the more organized appearance of the website, the latest information that is continuously updated, and the positive response from website users.",

Through the usage of artificial intelligence and web programming, the system facilitates project administration while maintaining easy to use interface. The platform also includes a title generator that employs advanced NLP models such as T5 and BART to generate relevant and original titles based on the abstracts of students’ topics. In addition, it provides summarising tools to help users create clear summaries of their work. The study includes a thorough survey of 40 students to determine their requirements and expectations of the system. We also discuss various aspects such as HCI usability, UX design, and common problems encountered by graduating college students. In addition, they describe the common thesis and project management systems in universities around the globe. The system features an interface for project management, a search bar for topic searching, and the BART and T5 models for title generation. The results of the evaluation of the system indicate a high degree of necessity and usability based on student feedback. The study ends with ideas for improvements that could be made in the future, such as a search bar that uses NLP to make it easier to find topics, students, or teachers.",

    "abstract": "Online discussion forums are widely used for active textual interaction between lecturers and students, and to see how the students have progressed in a learning process. The objective of this study is to compare appropriate machine-learning models to assess sentiments and Bloom’s epistemic taxonomy based on textual comments in educational discussion forums. The proposed method is called the hierarchical approach of Bloom-Epistemic and Sentiment Analysis (BE-Sent). The research methodology consists of three main steps. The first step is the data collection from the internal discussion forum and YouTube comments of a Web Programming channel. The next step is text preprocessing to annotate the text and clear unimportant words. Furthermore, with the text dataset that has been successfully cleaned, sentiment analysis and epistemic categorization will be done in each sentence of the text. Sentiment analysis is divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Bloom’s epistemic is divided into six categories: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. This research has succeeded in producing a course learning subsystem that assesses opinions based on text reviews of discussion forums according to the category of sentiment and epistemic analysis.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the design, implementation, and evaluation of an instructional strategy using Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots to support web programming (HTML5/CSS/JS) learning in 9th‑grade students from a public school in Monteria (Colombia). We followed a three‑cycle action‑research approach with 35 convenience‑sampled students. The intervention combined standard ChatGPT and a custom GPT (tutor role, curated prompt library, QR access), adapted to a resource‑constrained setting with unstable connectivity. Instruments included a diagnostic test, post‑test, performance rubrics, and a perception survey. Results showed gains in HTML5 structure/semantics, basic styling, and debugging: the average score increased from 3.0 to 4.2/5.0; 80% of students rated the chatbot positively for immediate feedback and availability. Findings align with recent evidence, highlighting opportunities (personalized scaffolding) and risks (hallucinations, bias, digital divide). We conclude that—with teacher mediation and active verification—LLM chatbots strengthen programming learning.",

The web programming course aims to shape students into website programmers. Independence in learning is needed so that competence is obtained. Students are not enough to rely on learning from the lecturer. This study aims to analyze the combination of the Inquiry-Based Learning model with IoT devices based on Android mobile. As a supporter, an application is built with a mobile programming language. This type of research is quasi-experimental. Calculations using SPSS 23.0. An experimental class learns to use the Inquiry-Based Learning model with IoT devices, and a control class learns with various media. The research subjects were 60 students of Information Management. The study found differences in students' competence and learning independence in those who learned to use the inquiry-based learning model with IoT devices compared to those who studied with various media. The test results showed a higher increase in the experimental class. The experimental class's value is 14.40 for a gain of 7.5. The sig. value is  .000, and the average gain is .83. Control class score is 11.87, an increase of 5.1, sig. value is .000, and the average gain is .53. Applying the inquiry-based learning model with IoT devices has also proven to be effective as a model and learning media in abnormal situations and reinforced by the average gain of the experimental class, which is greater than the control class. Future research could use different methods to determine what methods are most effective.",

    "abstract": "Web applications have become immensely popular and widely utilized across various sectors due to their accessibility, scalability, and ability to provide real-time updates, driving the demand for skilled web programmers. Approximately 75.9% of websites that use server-side languages rely on PHP, a widely adopted and flexible scripting language that integrates seamlessly with databases, making it suitable for dynamic website development. As the complexity of web development increases, self-learning systems become essential for fostering independent programming skills through platforms such as learning management systems (LMS) and MOOCs; however, many of these tools still require human intervention for code verification and lack automated feedback mechanisms. This study proposes a self-learning framework that leverages test-driven development (TDD) to enhance PHP programming education. The framework enables students to participate in structured learning modules, receive realtime feedback, and refine their coding abilities. An evaluation with 150 first-year IT students in Indonesia demonstrated a 100% success rate in all modules, where success was defined as the ability of students to pass all test cases in the predefined test suites after multiple attempts. This highlights the framework’s effectiveness while also noting areas for improvement in content depth and instructional clarity.",

    "abstract": "Students tend to copy programming assignments from their classmates in programming courses. Students copy codes in various ways, such as changing variable names and code structure order. Lecturers spend much time checking programming assignments, especially when the number of students enrolled in the course is large. They must check whether students have completed their programming assignments individually or copied their classmates' assignments. We developed a JavaScript code similarity detection application for web programming coursework using lexical analysis and Jero Winkler's Algorithm. Our application can detect the level of the students’ programming assignment similarity and assist the lecturer in deciding on plagiarism. ",

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within educational frameworks, particularly in disciplines such as web design and development, represents a significant evolution in pedagogical strategies. This article examines a unique educational setup where students, while engaging in a web design class, utilize AI tools for text, image, and code creation within a simulated real-world scenario involving a client—dubbed \"Chef Cookie Cutter\". This simulated client interaction introduces unpredictability through mid-assignment requirement changes, thereby mimicking the dynamic nature of real-world web development projects. The focus of this case study is the critical role of human-in-the-loop (HITL) engagement in AI-assisted assignments, where students' adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving skills are put to the test. Such engagement not only prepares students for the intricacies and challenges of their future professions but also emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI-driven processes. By incorporating generative AI, video avatars, and personalized learning mechanisms, this educational approach fosters a rich, interactive learning environment that enhances digital pedagogy. The findings suggest that integrating HITL in AI assignments significantly improves learning outcomes by fostering an adaptive learning environment that closely mirrors the complexities and demands of the industry, thereby preparing students more effectively for their future careers.",

All 510 Economics Education students enrolled in universities in the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja, Nigeria, make up the study's population. Because of the community's unique features and the researchers' adept management of its size, total population sampling was employed. There are 241 female and 269 male pupils in this group. The research questions were answered using mean scores with standard deviations, and the independent t-test was employed to test the hypotheses at the 0.05 significance level.  The findings of this study underscore the critical role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) entrepreneurship skills in equipping Economics Education students for self-employment in the contemporary digital economy and the study conclude that gender does not significantly influence the acquisition or Information and Communication Technology skills required for sustainability. The study recommends that universities offering Economics Education programs should revise their curricula to incorporate ICT entrepreneurship modules. These should include hands-on training in digital skills such as coding, web development, and digital marketing, ensuring that students graduate with practical and market-ready competencies amongst several others.",

This paper analyzes these problems with a proposed solution through Visual WebBits, a web-based platform designed to help students solve the hurdles of web design. With essential web development languages, code snippets highlighting design tutorials are provided. Intended for the use of the College of Computing and Information Technology, CCIT, the platform aims to facilitate instruction and learning by systematically providing learning materials on a single platform. It features a brief alignment with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) standards, which aims to enhance students' competencies, honing them into globally competitive industry professionals. The platform comes with a great amount of code snippets focused on design, tutorials, and real-time previews, which makes learning and development interactive, allowing students to digest lessons more easily. It also comes with personalized educator tools that will enable professors to make custom exercises, accurately track student progress, and conveniently present lessons for lectures. Visual WebBits thus supports both teaching and learning by organizing the educational resources needed. The system supports students and educators in the most user-friendly manner, from a live code editor to educational exercises to make the environment of web development more efficient and engaging. In conclusion, the initiative offers a scaled solution in which users are equipped with effective resources to optimize the web design process while improving their technical competencies.",

RhoArchitecture is an approach for designing and executing JSON-DSLs, incorporating a modular programming model, a JSON-based evaluation engine, and an integrated web development environment. This paper presents RestRho, a RESTful NodeJS server developed using two JSON-DSLs designed with RhoArchitecture: SQLRho and DBRestRho. These languages enable declarative specification of database operations and HTTP requests, respectively, supporting modularity, reuse, and template-based transformations. We validate the RestRho implementation through a dual approach. First, we apply software metrics to assess code quality, maintainability, and complexity. Second, we conduct an empirical study involving 39 final-year computer engineering students, who completed 18 structured tasks and provided feedback via questionnaires. The results demonstrate the tool’s usability, development efficiency, and potential for adoption in web application development.",

    "abstract": "With the rise in enrollment in computing programs, online learning offers the flexibility to scale up enrollment. To help students succeed in an online course, evidence-based engagement strategies need to be incorporated and evaluated for their effectiveness in increasing student engagement, which is a key determinant of student learning outcomes. This also addresses a concern with online learning, where students often feel detached and disengaged. In this innovative practice full paper, we describe our implementation of a study group strategy that we employed to increase students' engagement across different online formats of an upper-level computing course. Study groups are intended to allow students to discuss course concepts, foster social-emotional engagement, and provide positive learning experiences rather than being dependent on group members to complete a task or receive a grade. Although the strategy has been implemented in face-to-face computing courses, it has not been implemented and evaluated in different online formats of a computing course. The primary contribution of this study is the empirical evidence of the impact of study groups on students' learning outcome and engagement across the online formats of the course. The context of this study is an upper-level web-development course offered in different online formats, including online asynchronous in Spring 2020, online asynchronous and online hybrid in Fall 2020, and online synchronous in Spring 2021, where the study group strategy was employed. Three semesters of data collection were conducted using questionnaires administered at the beginning and end of the courses. Students learning outcomes and engagement were not significantly different between the different online course formats, allowing us to compare across the courses. Findings indicate that a study group strategy has a positive relationship with participation engagement in all of the online course formats. However, study groups may not directly influence learning outcomes. A study group strategy may improve learning outcomes in an online environment if the instructor facilitates the study group's work. This study has implications for utilizing study groups in different online formats of upper-level computing courses.",

    "abstract": "Testing is widely used as one of the methods of monitoring students' assimilation of knowledge and has a number of certain advantages over traditional methods of assessment. At schools and universities, tests can be used for monitoring and evaluate students' behavior, psyche, career guidance, or motivation. For a long time, paper tests have been used by educational institutions and private companies to assess student or employee performance. State exams and contests often include a multiple-choice test. Conducting such tests requires preparing a location for the test, spending time on checking and notifying students. Currently, there are a large number of different ways to monitor and evaluate knowledge. A tool for measuring a student's achievements is a properly designed test that corresponds not only to the subject of study, but also to its tasks and serves to develop a systematic approach to studying the discipline. Testing in educational institutions is used as a means of objective control of students' knowledge of the curriculum. Systematic monitoring of students' level of knowledge, on the one hand, determines the student's academic performance, and on the other hand, it is an indicator of the effectiveness of teaching methods and organization of the educational process. The inclusion of various forms of test tasks in the learning process motivates students to step up work on mastering educational material and forms a desire to develop their abilities. Comparing the testing performed with the help of paper questionnaires and online testing, it is obvious that online testing is much more effective.\n\nThe computer models of web-based knowledge verification services have been investigated in this paper by using methods of statistical and computer modeling. The research of knowledge control methods has been carried out and it has been shown that the time required to create a test and analyze the results in the perspective system could be minimized by using the modern technologies in the field of web development. The choice of the system architecture and a specific set of technologies depends on the requirement of maximizing speed of the system-user interaction. The analytical component of the system should answer the users’ most popular questions concerning the test results. The results obtained provide the main characteristics for creating a computer model of a web service for testing knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Web applications are increasingly the main way to create user interfaces, and they are often the most common software beginners have encountered. However, web development relies on concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies, which are challenges beyond the scope of an introductory course. Additionally, many features of modern web frameworks conflict with CS1 principles, such as avoiding global mutable state and promoting test-driven development. Consequently, web development is rarely integrated into CS1 courses, despite its motivational potential. This paper introduces Drafter, a new open-source Python library for CS1, enabling students to develop full-stack web applications using pure functions with minimal boilerplate. Drafter has simple functions to generate HTML, eliminating the need to learn HTML or templating languages. The data model scales with students' mastery of types, from primitives to nested lists, Dataclasses, and dictionaries. Drafter supports unit testing of entire web applications and reinforces CS1 concepts like decomposition and reusability. Websites created with Drafter can be deployed through GitHub Pages, with plotting and image manipulation. Students receive extensive debug information, including unit test scaffolding, program state visualization, and enhanced error messages and tests. This paper discusses the pedagogical features and design decisions behind Drafter, along with instructor reflections on its use. We believe Drafter can significantly enhance student engagement in CS1 courses and reinforce key learning objectives.",

    "abstract": "The “T multi-layer architecture” refers to the three-tier application architecture commonly used in web development, which consists of the presentation layer (client), application logic layer (middle tier), and data access layer (server). This architecture extends the traditional client/server model by introducing a dedicated application server layer to handle business logic, thereby separating user interface functions from data processing. The term “T” metaphorically represents the structural division among these layers, enabling modular management and load balancing. The client-server interaction follows a three-tier model: the client layer handles user interface communication, the application server layer processes business logic, and the data layer manages database operations. This separation allows the application server to share processing loads, addressing the overburden issue in traditional C/S architectures. The middle tier acts as a bridge, ensuring seamless data flow between the client and server. The 30% increase in student engagement was measured via dual methods (1) automated tracking of platform interactions (e.g., number of case studies accessed, quiz attempts, and discussion forum contributions): and (2) a 5-point Likert scale survey administered mid-course and at completion. For the 80% understanding improvement, students completed pre-and post-course concept mapping exercises focused on complex cost topics (e.g., bill of quantities valuation), with evaluators blind-coded to assess map complexity and accuracy. On average, students spend approximately 2 hours per week engaging with course content on the ECTP. A survey of students rated the user interface with a high ease-of-use score of 4.5. Furthermore, 70% of students noted significant improvements in their problem-solving abilities after using the platform. Project cost information management involves complex logic and lengthy processes. An efficient cost information system is essential to manage these workflows and standardize business procedures. The adaptive learning-based ECTP was designed with this goal in mind, integrating fragmented cost data for educational purposes.",

At Universitas Darma Persada, the career center faced challenges in disseminating job vacancy information efficiently due to time constraints and limited distribution methods, primarily via Instagram. This study aims to design and develop a web-based job vacancy information system to improve accessibility and communication between job seekers and employers.The uniqueness of this research lies in the development of a role-based job portal system that integrates multiple user roles, namely job seekers (students and alumni), career staff, and employers, into a single digital platform. The objective is to accelerate job vacancy publication, facilitate job applications, and streamline employer access to candidate data.This study adopts the Waterfall methodology, including stages of requirement analysis, system design, implementation, and testing. Data were collected through observation, interviews, and literature review. The final system was developed using Visual Studio Code, PHP, MySQL, and other web development tools.The results show that the system successfully reduces delays in job vacancy announcements, expands reach beyond Instagram, and provides a more structured and interactive recruitment process. Employers can post jobs and review CVs, while job seekers can apply directly and track their application status. The system has proven effective in enhancing the career center’s role in graduate employability support.",

In order to help students to understand each knowledge point and improve their engineering ability to solve practical problems, a DOM comprehensive experiment project similar to blind box is designed and implemented. This experimental project integrates knowledge points such as DOM events, DOM operations, and communication between objects. Practice has proved that running and debugging of the project can help students to understand and master relevant knowledge points.",

    "abstract": "\n Background : The use of new technologies and methodologies in young people’s mental health research is needed to allow more frequent and reliable sampling. Mobile applications and e-platforms create exciting potential for the collection of large-scale cohort data, however there are various feasibility and ethical issues to consider. Consultation with young people is needed to inform the research agenda, and ensure these technologies are engaging, useful and safe. This article describes the process of Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) with a sample of young people in London, with the aim of i) informing the development of a mood-monitoring e-platform, and ii) providing feedback and advice for researchers developing web-based technologies in the mental health field. Methods : A total of 26 young people were consulted across four advisory group sessions. All young people were students enrolled at one of the participating London based sixth form colleges, and voluntarily attended a workshop session. Audio recordings of the sessions were analysed using a theory driven thematic analysis framework. Results: Young people were generally receptive to e-health technologies and valued the opportunity to collaborate throughout the development process. The advisory groups identified key considerations for future web-development work to encourage engagement and prolonged use, including, the promotion of trust and transparency, consideration of accessibility, provision of support, production of engaging and functional design, and acknowledgment of specific contextual influences surrounding young people’s wellbeing. Conclusions : Involving young people in the development process of e-health technologies contributes to optimising the successful adoption and prolonged usage of new methodologies. The thematic map outlines can be used to inform researchers interested in developing web-based technologies in the mental health field and will be directly applicable to the development of a mood-monitoring e-platform.",

The cloud storages give certain amount of the storage and then start asking the users to pay for the subscription model. Using Microprocessors and web development, it can offer you a better solution to have a personalised Private cloud storage. A private cloud storage is a storage solution that is hosted on your own network, rather than on a third-party service. This means that your data is stored in a more secure location and you have more control over it. Microprocessors can be used to create a private storage and which will be only accessible to the particular users only. Microprocessors like raspberry pi and the hard drive like SD cards, HDDs are been used to make a private cloud storage. We are installing a NAS server in the raspberry pi and create the website which is used to access the private cloud storage. NAS servers can be secured using a variety of methods, such as encryption and authentication. This helps to protect data from unauthorized access. NAS servers can be secured using a variety of methods, such as encryption and authentication. This helps to protect data from unauthorized access.

To assist self-studies of novice students, we have developed the JavaScript-based web-client programming learning assistant system (JSPLAS). It offers various types of exercise problems with different learning goals, where any answer from a student is automatically marked in the system. In this paper, we present a design of the phrase fill-in-blank problem (PFP) in JSPLAS. A PFP instance provides a source code for web-client programming where several phrases are blanked out, and requests students to fill them in correctly. A phrase consists of one or multiple elements in the code. The correctness of any answer is verified through string matching with the original phrase. In future works, we will generate PFP instances for basic web-client programming concepts and assign them to students for comprehensive evaluations of the proposal. Besides, we will implement the automatic generation program of a new PFP instance to assist teachers.",

    "abstract": "The Exploring Computer Science (ECS) program, designed to increase underrepresented groups' participation in computer science (CS), adapted its web development unit in Milwaukee during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new curriculum uses the ECS Web Lab (ECS-WL) platform, which facilitates real-time HTML and CSS compilation, allowing students to create and submit web pages for teacher feedback. Each day in the curriculum, students research specific topics of interest and incorporate those ideas into the websites they develop. This hands-on approach, tailored to students' interests, aims to enhance engagement and learning effectiveness. A comprehensive assessment strategy will analyze data from ECS-WL to gauge the program's impact on inclusivity and engagement in computer science education (CSE). These findings will guide future enhancements, ensuring ECS's commitment to diversifying CSE.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring effective communication between students and academic administration is essential for a seamless and responsive educational experience. Despite this, many institutions continue to use outdated or informal methods for managing student complaints, leading to inefficiencies, a lack of accountability, and unresolved issues. This research paper introduces the development and implementation of a Student Review and Complaint System, a comprehensive web-based solution aimed at closing the communication gap between students and administrative bodies, particularly Heads of Departments (HODs). The system allows students to easily submit complaints or feedback about campus facilities, faculty behavior, academic issues, or general grievances through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Students can also attach images or media files to support their submissions, ensuring that complaints are well-documented and verifiable. On the administrative side, HODs and other authorized personnel have access to a secure dashboard to review, track, and respond to complaints promptly.\n\n\n The application is constructed using the MERN stack—MongoDB for database management, Express.js for backend API handling, React.js for a dynamic frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment. Security and privacy are prioritized through JWT-based authentication, enabling strict role-based access control to differentiate between student and admin functionalities. This paper further explores the system's technical architecture, development workflow, challenges faced during implementation, and the overall benefits of introducing such a digital complaint system in academic institutions. By automating the complaint process and maintaining a structured feedback loop, the system enhances transparency, improves responsiveness, and fosters accountability within educational environments.\n\nKeywords: Student Complaint System, Student Review Portal, MERN Stack, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, JWT Authentication, Role-Based Access Control, Web Development, Media Upload Feature, Academic Feedback, Educational Technology, Campus Issue Resolution, Admin Dashboard, Complaint Tracking System",

    "abstract": "Student success is a growing concern in higher education institutions. How can educators create courses that better prepare students for their future careers? The purpose of this paper is to present recommendations that will assist educators in helping students to be successful in college. This paper begins by briefly discussing a service-learning project (SLP). Next, the paper compares the advantages and disadvantages of completing a simulated project against a service-learning project in a web development course from a teacher’s perspective. Additionally, this paper explores the students’ and clients’ perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of SLPs. This paper also outlines a model for teaching a web development course with the integration of a service-learning project. Finally, the paper concludes with the idea that community service-based projects can benefit all parties involved and should be considered when designing the pedagogy for an advanced web development course. This study, along with others referenced in the paper, finds that service-learning projects provide a framework for structuring an effective course curriculum.",

Although the work we do as ethnomusicologists sits at the forefront of gathering engaging, relevant content related to musical expressions, most ethnomusicologists are ill equipped in delivering their findings to a broader audience through the use of new media and post-production techniques such as video, sound, and image editing, web development, database administration, and network administration, among many others. Although plenty of literature about developing these skills exists as stand-alone instruction, in this essay I present a bird’s-eye view of content production from an ethnomusicological perspective, providing an understanding of not only content production but how intersects with revenue and ethnomusicological goals. I do so by sharing more than twenty years of experience as an IT specialist and consultant and by exploring some examples of content production at Smithsonian Folkways.",

The software is distributed both as native packages and specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing development and testing of the system even when offline. They simplified the training and onboarding of new team members and summer interns. And they were useful in workshops where students could have first-hand experience with the mechanisms and components that, in production, run millions of jobs.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for flexible and self-paced learning in higher education has underscored the need for intelligent digital tools that support autonomous study, particularly in foundational technical domains such as web development. This study aims to design and implement an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to facilitate independent learning among undergraduate students in basic web development courses. The ITS was developed using the Laravel framework and integrated with a MySQL database, incorporating client-side and serverside programming components to deliver structured instructional content, interactive exercises, and automated feedback. A structured software development methodology, including requirements analysis, system design through use case and class diagrams, and iterative interface prototyping via Figma, guided the development process. The ITS was designed to supplement existing e-learning platforms and is intended to enhance accessibility, self-regulation, and learner engagement, particularly for students needing to review or retake the course material. Preliminary implementation results suggest that the system supports autonomous learning by providing modular course content, instructor-curated assessments, and a user-friendly interface. The platform also includes feedback mechanisms to continuously refine the instructional material based on learner input. The findings indicate that Intelligent Tutoring Systems have the potential to improve student outcomes by fostering independent learning habits and providing scalable instructional support in computer science education. This research contributes to the advancement of personalized e-learning technologies and offers a practical framework for ITS development in resource-constrained academic environments.",

Currently, the KRS process still utilizes a digital questionnaire in the form of a Google Form, which is less efficient and accurate. Therefore, the author constructs a web-based system using PHP Laravel, employing the Web Development Life Cycle (WDLC) approach. This web-based KRS system enables students to perform the KRS process online, access class schedules, and view the availability and quotas of subjects. Teachers and school administrators can efficiently manage and monitor the KRS process. This development is expected to provide benefits such as time and resource efficiency, data accuracy, ease of access, and an enhanced user experience in arranging schedules and selecting subjects.",

    "abstract": "Most CS1 classes are designed to teach programming and computational thinking using a specific programming language such as Python or Java. This type of in-depth study leaves little room for creative exploration by students. In particular, at large colleges and universities, the programming assignments are usually autograded to keep up with expanding enrollment. This lightning talk will introduce the idea that simply adding three creative labs that do not use the actual course material, but instead expose students to other computing concepts, can give the students who are struggling a chance to catch up, while also offering them a much-needed breather doing something in computing that is individually directed and creative. Over the last few years, my Teaching Assistants (TAs) and I have developed three simple web development labs as assignments for our large CS1 classes. These three labs are usually given around each of the exam weeks and provide a much-needed break for the students from the regular class material that continues to build upon prior learning. Many students report that the labs were their favorite part of the course because they were creative and self-directed. This lightning talk aims to gather feedback on this concept and assess its potential for integration into advanced CS courses. I'm also keen to hear suggestions for alternative labs in a CS1 class that would both introduce students to further CS principles and allow them to showcase their creativity.",

    "abstract": "Background & Objectives: Digitalisation across the globe has massively expanded the use of the internet and technology which can benefit in making physiology education more diverse, inclusive and culturally responsive. Access to a wealth of educational resources through digital platforms has democratized learning, particularly in areas where physical resources may be limited. Social Media can enable students from diverse backgrounds to access physiology education from institutions worldwide, providing options that suit individual needs and schedules.The purpose of this study is to understand the role that social media could play as an effcient learning tool to promote an equitable and inclusive learning environment in physiology. Methods: This survey-based study was conducted among Health Profession students of the medical and nursing fields using a structured questionnaire with 12 items. The opinions of students towards using social media as an emerging learning tool in physiology education were obtained on a 5-point Likert scale and studied under 3 themes- i) Utility in Medical Education, iii) Dependence and iii) Personal Practices. The opinions were compared on the basis of time that medical and nursing students could dedicate to social media for learning owing to their busy academic schedule. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) of all continuous variables were descriptively analysed using univariate statistics and the differences were compared using T-test, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Mann–Whitney U test and Krushkall Wallis test were performed to identify differences in non-normal distribution. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 17) for Microsoft Windows, SPSS Inc. USA was used. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Our study included 50% medical and 50% nursing students with over 90% of them using social media. Highly positive responses for the utility of social media in physiology education indicate welcoming attitudes towards technology-based learning to promote inclusivity. However medical students perceived that their schedule is too busy to participate in social media (p-value < 0.05). Also, 78% were either unsure or believed social media would consume a lot of time. Even though students routinely used social media, the accuracy and reliability of social media as a learning tool was a major concern among students. Conclusion: Our study underscores the promise of social media as a powerful tool for enhancing inclusivity in physiology education. The enthusiasm of students for using these platforms in their learning journey is evident. However, the demanding schedules of medical students and concerns about resource reliability must be acknowledged as potential roadblocks. To unlock the full potential of social media in physiology education, it is imperative that educational institutions and educators address these challenges through strategic planning and assurance measures. By doing so, we can create an educational landscape that is both equitable and of high quality, where all students can benefit from the advantages of social media in their learning. This research serves as a call to action, encouraging further exploration and innovation in this field, ultimately advancing the delivery of physiology education in the digital age.

    "abstract": "As class sizes grow, providing high-quality, accurate, timely feedback\n on student projects becomes increasingly difficult for instructors. This\n research explores the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) to\n assist instructors in providing student feedback. The authors hypothesized\n that AI Large Language Models can provide valuable, accurate, and timely\n feedback on student papers in a physiology class. The tested sample\n comprised thirty-two written papers of around 1.5 to 3 pages in length, each\n evaluating two medical TV drama episodes across seven point scale rubric\n categories. Since the papers were sampled from a pre-existing data set, they\n had previously been scored with a point scale rubric once (human existing)\n by a single reviewer. Papers were de-identified and rescored by three\n independent reviewers (human new, scores averaged) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n (July 1, 2024 version). Investigators looked at the time to completion,\n written feedback, and rubric point scale scoring. Point scale scoring was\n the only consistent comparison across all three evaluations. This is because\n Human existing scores did not initially include written feedback and time to\n completion. Human new scores did not include written feedback in order to\n mimic the original scoring workflow. We prompted AI to include written\n feedback as an experimental extension since this required no additional\n effort. A one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences\n between the existing human scores (human existing), the new human scores\n (human new), and the scores generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet (F = 0.12, p =\n 0.89), indicating high accuracy for each scoring method. Human new scoring\n took an average of 3 minutes and 19 seconds for each paper with no written\n feedback. AI completed its assessment, which included written feedback, in\n under 10 seconds per paper. The instructor judged AI feedback to be robust,\n accurate, and highly relevant. The results suggest that AI could enhance\n academic performance by directly providing students with quality feedback\n before submitting an assignment. This could also free the instructor to\n focus on teaching and curriculum development. Future research should explore\n productive workflows and methods of assessment for AI-assisted student work\n that promote targeted learning outcomes.\n This project was funded by the Department of Physiology at Michigan\n State University\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "The paper presents the use of information and communications technology to enhance the learning in case of a laboratory module, called \"Loop forming processes\" within the curricula of \"Basis of Knitting Technology\" course. Among the designed and used means for the learning module are those frequently used in case of knitting technology such as: html interactive animations showing the successive phases of loop forming cycle, electronic albums, video clips. All these means offer the possibility for an interactive and programmed learning of the \"Loop forming processes\" and an easy understanding of the loop forming phases during of the knitting cycle in case of spring bearded needles, latch needles and compound needles. Corel Draw was used for the drawings, Corel Rave for the interactive animations and video camera, for the video clips. The laboratory module was designed based on an XML file taken as a model, amended contents according to the needs of the laboratory and then used for transformation in the HTML laboratory module using the ModulEst application. The laboratory module has an interactive graphical structure and contains navigation icons for direct access to the bibliography, webography, glossary, summary help page and test for self-programming and verification. The learning modules are accompanied by three different online quizzes that were used at the three stages of learning module: at the beginning of the learning module, to evaluate the students prior knowledge, during the learning module, to see students progress as they learn (assessment for learning) and at the end of the learning module, to gauge the students received knowledge (assessment of learning). The authors consider the designed modules as innovative learning methods that support learning in engineering education at the Faculty of Textiles-Leather and Industrial Management.",

    "abstract": "Students find pulmonary physiology difficult and complex. Information overload is a strong deterrent of learning and decreases motivation. Function diagrams are simplified renditions of a complex system that can house a series of analogies and mnemonics for the purpose of concept elaboration and knowledge retrieval. This lung function diagram uses the five lobes (3 of the right and 2 of the left) to link several analogies that when put together describes the major lung functions. The five lobes correspond to (i) Lung compliance & surface tension, (ii) Mechanics of breathing & airway resistance, (iii) Control of breathing, (iv) Gas diffusion and oxygen transport, and (v) Ventilation-perfusion matching. Each lobe serves as a memory palace location for one of the five items but the lobe housing an item has no anatomical relation. The first image is of someone doing a belly flop while holding a big, medium, and small balloon. The small balloon represents thick-walled hard-to-inflate balloon (analogy of fibrosed lung), the medium balloon medium-walled normally-inflated (analogy of normal lung), and the big balloon represents a thin-walled easily-inflated balloon (higher compliance). The belly flop represents water’s high surface tension. The second image is of a mechanic turning on a water spicket. Here the mechanic represents the mechanics involved in respiration. The flow of a liquid out the spicket represents narrow vs. wider aperture extrapolates to air flow and determinants of airway resistance, especially if different size hoses are attached. The third image is of a computer circuit board connected to a small motor. This represents the regulation of respiration, accepting inputs and back-and-forth circuitry with outputs to increase or decrease the speed of the motor or ventilation. The forth image is of a car filled with three commuters returning home (blood flow returning to the lungs) and soda cans and baking soda in the trunk. In this image the four-seat car represents hemoglobin with its four oxygen binding sites, each passenger is an oxygen. The soda represents dissolved carbon dioxide, baking soda represents bicarbonate, and the trunk is the hemoglobin site that binds to carbon dioxide. Passengers getting into of the car and soda cans and baking soda being unloaded from the trunk represents O2 and CO2 binding/unbinding. The final image of gas tanks traveling down a conveyer belt to be filled. Here the gas filling rate of partially filled cylinders represents ventilation, the speed of belt carrying these cylinders represents perfusion. Our overall premise is that simple witty memorable diagrams, function diagrams, that do not look like a detailed figures and graphs may facilitate elaboration and decrease perceived perplexity of learning difficult topics such as pulmonary physiology.

The benefits of using interactive applications in education have been discussed for a long time and have demonstrated that they can increase the cognitive capacity as well as facilitate fixation of information. In this work is presented an application to support learning the molecular basis of endocrine physiology. The application was developed in HTML and JAVA and made available online on the website http://www.biomol.net/aulas/endocrinomol/. The application presents  a theoretical introductory section on the basic concepts of endocrine physiology and another of interaction with three-dimensional hormone molecules. The three-dimensional models are accompanied by questions to be answered by students. The application was  used in classes of Biomedicine of Universidade Severino Sombra (USS) and was evaluated by the students through spontaneous comments and Likert five-point questionnaire with questions covering usability, structure of the application and its use as a learning tool.

    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES include: (1) assessing the proportion of undergraduate\n physiology students who described aspects of course structure in an\n open-ended final course reflection, and (2) how students described the\n physiology course structure in relation to transferable skills. HYPOTHESIS:\n We predicted the majority of students would describe course structure in\n relation to UDL and transferable skills. METHODOLOGY & DATA: Of the 315\n enrolled students, 295 students completed the final course reflection and\n 138 signed informed consent forms to allow their responses to be used for\n the study (n=138/295, 46.8% participation rate). Through qualitative content\n analysis, we developed an initial codebook, revised the codebook, and\n exceeded the 0.80 threshold for Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) using\n Krippendorff's Alpha to establish the final codebook. To support data\n triangulation, we also used an AI-powered tool with commercial data\n protection to analyze student responses by copying about 30% of student\n responses (n=42/138) into Microsoft Copilot (UGA internal server) with\n prompts to develop themes and compare these themes to our final codebook.\n RESULTS: Through deductive coding of student responses, we constructed the\n following categories in our final codebook: (1) Weekly Classroom Assessment\n Techniques (Muddy Mondays, Working Wednesdays, Freaky Fridays) and (2)\n Additional Aspects of Course Structure, both in-class (e.g., Core Concepts,\n PLAs, Rainchecks) or outside of class (e.g., practice questions,\n supplemental videos). Preliminary results from a single coder show over 70%\n of students (n=102/138) described in detail how aspects of the course\n structure were useful for them in other contexts and supported their\n learning. Nearly 55% of students describe some aspect of UDL principles in\n their responses. To ensure scientific rigor and bias reduction, validation\n of the codebook is underway with two unbiased coders who achieved IRR,\n independently reviewed student responses, and are coding to consensus.\n CONCLUSIONS: Students overall show evidence of applying strategies from a\n single course to other courses to support study habits and collaborative\n learning. Our study offers a comprehensive overview of multiple components\n of course structure that students cite as supporting transferable skill\n development with implications for education researchers who assess and\n instructors who apply active learning strategies in instructional design for\n undergraduate physiology courses.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Prior to Fall 2023, the two medical campuses of the University of Minnesota, have hadtwo different curricula. Though the Duluth campus has delivered an integrative, systems-based curriculum, the Twin Cities campus has delivered a discipline-basedcurriculum. Outcome measures (1) pass rate and scores on Step 1 board exams, 2)graduation data and 3) match success) demonstrate strong comparability betweenthe two curricula. Starting in September 2020, another opportunity for comparisonoccurred; a single instructor taught pulmonary content to both the Duluth (Fall 2020)and Twin Cities (Spring 2020) cohorts and another single instructor taughtcardiovascular content to both the Duluth (Fall 2020) and Twin Cities (Spring 2021)cohorts. Both cohorts were given and assessed on the same set of learning objectives;leading us to ask the following question: Does the structure of the preclinical curriculum(systems vs discipline-based) impact the learning outcomes of physiology, particularlythe ability to integrate material? We compared the two cohorts by comparing acommon set of exam questions assessing cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology. Wemeasured question performance by question diffculty index (expressed as a percent)and question cognitive level by determining the Bloom’s Taxonomy Cognitive level(knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation). We foundno differences between the cohorts in question diffculty as a function of content typeor levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. We conclude that there was no difference in overallperformance of the Duluth and Twin Cities cohorts despite receiving different curricularapproaches. However, we had an unexpected finding from the analytics; thecardiovascular items were significantly more diffcult than the pulmonary items. Thisresult has implications for a team-taught medical school curriculum given the source ofthe difference could be the difference in teaching style, the difference in content or thedifference in item writing. We therefore are beginning an exploration of the differencein item analysis and possible impacts on student evaluations. The important of this lineof inquiry is that first, consistency in item diffculty potentially impacts a competencybased medical curriculum and second, how students perceive differences in itemdiffculty has the potential to affects instructor evaluations and therefore promotionand tenure.

    "abstract": "Extracurriculars in education are intended to answer the demands of student’s needs. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will be assisted with creative learning patterns that can increase creativity. In fact, in limited school hours there are many activities that cannot always be carried out, so extracurriculars are created where the implementation is carried out outside school hours to accommodate students in meeting their needs, interests and talents. The management of the extracurricular information system at SMA X has problems, where students sometimes do not get information such as schedules, grades, extracurricular activities and extracurricular registration is done by submitting registration forms where this activity results in file accumulation, which is of course very ineffective nowadays. \n  \nFrom the existing problems, the researchers created a web-based extracurricular management information system with HTML, PHP, Bootstrap and database programming languages. This system was tested using the usability testing method which was directly tested on extracurricular members. The method used in the development of the system is the waterfall method. This system is expected to facilitate the extracurricular information management process and can provide extensive information about the extracurricular activities themselves, so that the information provided is not broken down and integrated in one system and can be useful for students, teachers and schools.",

    "abstract": "Inequities and achievement gaps exist for students from groups underrepresented in medicine (URiM) and for English language learners (ELLs). This is particularly evident with multiple choice assessments which are prevalent in health professions and medical education. Increasing the linguistic accessibility of test items by simplifying the language used while keeping the content diffculty was perceived as helpful to ELLs in an undergraduate Chemistry course (Lee & Orgill, 2022). Following best practices when writing exam questions provides consistent and valid measures of student comprehension. Across institutions we face similar challenges when forming and assessing multiple choice questions for our physiology exams. Some major flaws include long complex options; using vague terms; negatively structured stems; grammatical cues; word repeats. Lopez (2023) found that 56% items contained at least one flaw. The most common flaws identified were those in which the items were not approximately the same length and item options that did not have parallel grammatical form and structure. In order to address these issues in an objective way, we collectively modified the previously detailed rubric (Lopez, 2023) for identifying common flaws based on the “Item-Writing Guide” from the National Board of Medical Education (NBME®) and one formed in the context of general chemistry by Breakall et al. (2019). Twenty-six questions from physiology exams at three different institutions were evaluated by three faculty using the newly created rubric. After analyzing the questions, we returned as a group and compared our individual ratings, clarified any discrepancies and modified the rubric accordingly. We will conduct statistical analysis to assess our inter-rater reliability score before using this rubric to analyze the full question banks for physiology exams at each institution. This process is not limited to physiology educators since it can be utilized by teachers in any program or discipline. The significance of the work will not only benefit our validation of learning but it will also address specific equity issues by eliminating flaws that provide irrelevant diffculty or benefit test wise students. Furthermore, this rubric is also helpful in generating new questions for future exams, ensuring equitable assessments. References: Breakall, J., Randles, C., & Tasker, R. (2019).

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of an interactive web-based platform aimed at enhancing English language learning through the utilization of digital twins, powered by the GPT-3.5 model. The platform integrates three primary services essential for language learning: vocabulary acquisition, grammar checking, and conversational practice via simulated interlocutors, offering a dynamic, personalized learning experience. Detailed technical aspects of the system’s architecture are discussed, highlighting the implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, which ensures modularity and scalability. The platform’s backend is developed using C# for reliability and performance, while the frontend leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive, user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.\nTo support large volumes of user data, a Microsoft Azure SQL Database is employed for robust data management, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user information, interaction histories, and progress logs. Integration with GPT-3.5 via OpenAI's API facilitates real-time query processing and response generation, making the platform a powerful tool.\nThe platform uses advanced personalization algorithms to adjust learning content based on user preferences, progress, and interaction history. This personalized approach increases student engagement and promotes more effective learning outcomes by adapting content to individual needs.\nSecurity and ethical considerations are addressed through encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms. In addition, OpenAI’s built-in content filtering systems ensure that inappropriate or harmful content is blocked, safeguarding users while maintaining high ethical standards. Furthermore, a detailed cost calculation model for token usage is presented, which allows for precise tracking of operational costs, ensuring the platform’s long-term sustainability.\nBy integrating cutting-edge technology with pedagogical principles, this platform demonstrates the potential to revolutionize English language learning in higher education institutions, making it more interactive, personalized, and effective.",

    "abstract": "The research question of this paper is - How can we better help professors with developing course descriptions and how we can help study program directors to reach study program aims through learning outcomes? This issue is very common for all Latvian higher education institutions as well as other higher education institutions outside of Latvia. It became clear after reading the new changes of the Law of Higher Education of the Republic of Latvia that two major changes had to be made first in course descriptions: updating the course descriptions to the new requirements and creating a mapping of the study programs. The decision was made to start work on a Course Management System. The goal purpose was to create a Course Management System that will help professors with developing course descriptions and will help study program directors to reach study program aims through learning outcomes. At first together with students the authors did a detailed analysis of the system and then developed it. Now the system is ready for implementation. Thanks to the developed system at Ventspils University of Applied Sciences has solved several important issues related to the course descriptions. For study programme learning outcome alignment with study course learning outcome will be used matrix method.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted education, particularly in\n secondary institutions, prompting a shift to blended and online learning\n environments. This study explores the correlation between non-traditional\n students and traditional students in their first year of osteopathic medical\n school. Non-traditional is defined as gap year students, graduate students,\n and post-baccalaureate students while traditional students include\n undergraduates who enrolled in courses directly from high school, attended\n full-time, and have limited life and work responsibilities. We conducted a\n survey of a 175 osteopathic medical students at the conclusion of their\n first academic year to assess academic performance and preparedness. 24\n respondents provided scores from a six-week introductory basic science\n course (M2P) and a first-year nervous system course (NVS1). Additionally,\n students detailed their educational settings (online, hybrid, or in-person)\n and test-taking styles (such as open-book, closed-book, lockdown browser,\n and handwritten formats). Emotional indices were obtained at the end of the\n first year curriculum. Respondents were asked to judge their psychological\n preparedness (Emotional Index Score) before matriculation and at the\n conclusion of year one coursework to understand the psychological\n preparedness of both groups. Preliminary findings suggest that\n non-traditional students were slightly more confident in their abilities\n prior to matriculation compared to the traditional students. The\n non-traditional groupings also gained confidence and reported higher index\n scores at the conclusion of coursework and at the completion of the first\n year. Academic performance metrics reveal that the non-traditional students\n performed similarly throughout the year as the traditional students. These\n findings suggest that non-traditional students may feel more emotionally\n prepared for the rigor of medical school prior to matriculation. This study\n highlights the nuanced differences in preparedness and performance between\n non-traditional and traditional medical students in their first year. Our\n findings underscore the importance of understanding the unique challenges\n and strengths each group faces, particularly in the context of adapting to\n new learning modalities prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research\n is needed to explore long-term implications on academic success and\n emotional well-being in medical education.\n Burrell College of Osteopathic Medicine Research Office\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Animal dissections are a common approach to teaching anatomy and physiology, but they are costly, pose safety risks, and raise ethical concerns. Alternatives like computer simulations and synthetic specimens have been explored, but they lack the realism of live dissections. Virtual reality (VR) technology provides a promising solution by immersing learners in a virtual environment that closely mimics real-life dissections and allows for skill development and feedback. VR also removes ethical and emotional concerns associated with dissections and enhances learning opportunities. To explore the effectiveness of VR in anatomy and physiology education, we conducted a detailed survey of 48 students in an undergraduate physiology laboratory course. The survey, administered before and after students performed both a VR frog dissection and an in-person frog dissection, was designed to gauge their perceptions, preferences, and learning experiences with both methods. Results indicate that while no participants considered VR a perfect substitute, a majority (80%) still viewed animal dissections as an essential part of science laboratory courses. Interestingly, 43% of participants expressed a stronger preference for live dissections post-experiment, citing greater excitement and perceived informativeness. In contrast, 25% favored VR or alternative methods, highlighting increased comfort and reduced discomfort. A recurring theme was VR's role as a preparatory or alternative tool for those hesitant towards live dissection. This study underscores VR's potential in addressing traditional dissection methods' limitations and emphasizes the need for further research into VR's effectiveness in anatomy and physiology education. We aim to foster dialogue on the use of alternative technologies in enhancing learning opportunities within laboratory and clinical sciences.

Every information that attractive and easy to understanding is very important to give big impact for every primary school student, it also can provide a pleasant learning experience for these students. Therefore, this research develops a smartphone application that can provide a pleasant experience in learning knowledge of the surrounding environment from objects with virtual reality technology. To display these objects, a 360 ° panoramic image is used or a 2048px width 1024px width with a wide viewing angle (360 degrees) and this can be done by teachers to make the image or search for material sources on the internet. This technology allows students to see objects virtually. In use, this study requires a VR headset as a device for visualizing stereoscopic displays but it does not need installation because it is enough to access a smartphone browser then it will work. The system is designed using the spiral method as a process model and uses a-frame in application development. The interface can be run on the Android operating system. In making this application using the html programming language, laravel framework and a-frame framework.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are options for training IT specialists in the educational services market. They overwhelmingly do not take into account the student’s personal characteristics, as well as the market needs in labors. To solve these problems, the authors have developed software complex SkillsForYou (in the Python programming language), which has a modular structure that allows implementing support for the IT specialists training based on the cycle of automated management of training IT specialists (based on the theory of organizational systems management and consisting of stages of planning, organization, stimulation, control). The SkillsForYou contains a large number of training courses of different complexity in various languages and programming technologies (Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP). The complex includes a module for analyzing the personal and psychological learner’s qualities, which contains many different psychological tests to assess the quality formation-level necessary for IT specialists, and the specialist team formation to collaborate on projects. The mathematical module on the psychological testing results and the results of calculations using swarm intelligence algorithms determine recommendations for organizing the learning process for each learner. Swarm intelligence algorithms use statistics on the complexity of the problems selected for solving. Problems for training courses are in accordance with the taxonomy of Bloom's training goals, and to assess the problem complexity to solve, the course teacher assigns a cost to the problems. In order to facilitate the search for applicants by HR specialists and employers the software complex stores the education history in the learning courses and the learners’ rating.",

    "abstract": "Online learning is the modern version of distance learning. Driven by the readily available and easily accessible digital technology and the necessity to deliver classes online during the recent pandemic, it has surpassed previous forms of distance learning in its popularity and impact to become the new normal in education in many parts of the world. Apart from technological and environmental factors, effective online course delivery relies on appropriate instructional design and good pedagogical practices to engage and motivate students. This paper describes an interactive approach of online course delivery with H5P integration, a plugin with enriched HTML 5 content to existing lecture videos that enables interactions between the instructor and students and among students. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated with student quiz scores in two undergraduate linguistics courses delivered face-to-face in a classroom and asynchronous online respectively. While the quiz scores of the latter were slightly lower, no statistically significant difference was found, indicating the asynchronous online class with H5P integration produced similar learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "With the advances in technology, it is noticeable the educational potential of animation in the field of cell biology, physiology and other basic life science disciplines, revolutionizing the learning process in science. This paper elucidates the role of matrix manipulation in animating figures on screens, elucidates the distinctions between Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), bitmap and raster images, and unveils the inner workings of the Bresenham algorithm in the context of rendering lines on screens. Furthermore, the article offers a practical dimension to this theoretical understanding by providing a comprehensive example of code written in JavaScript for generating an animation, also using HTML and CSS. This code example is designed to be easy to comprehend, even to those with limited programming experience, fostering the integration of animations into life science education. We synthesized findings from various studies to underscore the proven advantages of this new teaching tool, and by reviewing them, we reaffirm that animations have a demonstrable impact on improving the learning experience, making complex physiological processes more comprehensible and engaging. This highlights the critical role of animations as a pedagogical tool in science classrooms, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the mathematical and computational principles that support their creation. By bridging this knowledge gap, educators and students can make more effective and informed use of existing animation tools.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Physiology Education began publishing papers in 2005, using classic papers in physiology teaching [1]. This approach has several valuable outcomes: Classic experiments, conclusion of which form the foundation of much of our undergraduate teaching textbooks, require less specialized knowledge to understand and interpret the data and conclusions. It demonstrates the scientific method, demonstrating both \"what do we know\" and \"how do we know.\" It promotes inquiry-based learning. It fosters data literacy, teaching students to interpret graphs and provides historical context for physiology [1]. Traditional practical classes achieve many of these outcomes while also providing a tactile experience, and have added benefits to students’ data literacy — in as much as the students perform the protocols themselves. Students will gain insight to what “squiggly lines” on a screen are measuring and the individual variability in what raw physiological recordings look like. Students will gain a greater appreciation for analytical techniques, and the manipulations and analysis that needs to be performed to interpret data. Students also gain an appreciation of the difference between textbook vs real data. Nevertheless, in person practical classes have limitations due to resource intensity, including space, materials, and curriculum time. HumMod (hummod.org) is a freely available mathematical model of Human Physiology, a \"time-dependent physiologic simulation engine\" [2]. JustPhysiology (justphysiology.com) is an education-focused web interface for HumMod [3]. We have written four physiology-based workshops utilizing simulated data from JustPhysiology. The JustPhysiology workshops were setup as a structured inquiry activity where students are expected to apply their content knowledge to interpret data, and students submitted their reports after each workshop for evaluation and feedback. In preparing the workshop activities for deployment, we trialed the activities with students who had previously completed our second year Human Physiology subject (and were thus familiar with the content). We then engaged students in focus group interviews —ascertaining the students’ perceptions of the learning experience. The outcome of the focus group interview suggests that students engaging with the workshop tasks enter into a positive learning cycle: [Formula: see text] The spontaneous emergence of a learning cycle, promoting deeper understanding of the physiology suggests that these data driven workshops will have improve student learning in Human Physiology.

    "abstract": "In light of the overturning of Roe v. Wade & the emergence of\n medically unfounded laws, understanding undergraduate (UG) students'\n knowledge on reproduction is vital. Undergraduate (UG) students represent\n the future voters & leaders in our country. We believe it is important\n to understand their knowledge of this aspect of physiology given the\n importance of reproductive freedoms & their connection to medical\n knowledge. Currently, there is little information about these topics\n reported in the literature. We surveyed UG students to gather their\n understanding of reproductive knowledge relevant to abortion & the\n source of this knowledge. We asked the following research questions: 1. What\n relevant knowledge do UG students have concerning reproductive physiology\n related to pregnancy & embryonic development? 2. What sources of\n knowledge do UG students disclose about these topics? A survey was designed\n to assess UG knowledge of reproduction & pregnancy-related topics\n including definitions & timeline of pregnancy, heart development, pain\n sensation, & age of viability. Five open-ended questions assessed\n student knowledge of these topics. Each question was followed by the\n open-ended question of “How do you know this information?” The survey was\n distributed on social media by members of the research team. In total, 72\n responses were collected between July 2022 & February 2023 & then\n analyzed. Question responses were analyzed using multiple rounds of coding,\n as described by Saldana. First, research team members sought ‘answers’ for\n each content question using medical journals & textbooks. Next, all\n responses to that content question were reviewed by the researcher who\n compiled ‘correct’ answers using an open coding process. Responses were\n scored for correctness & assigned a code. Source of knowledge responses\n were scored by a single researcher using an initial framework informed by\n Hadad and Simonson et al. The initial codebook for each question was\n presented to the full research team for review & critique. This was\n followed by code mapping for each survey question & a second round of\n coding. All rounds of coding used the constant comparative method &\n changes to codes or code assignment were discussed to consensus. Coding\n choices were entered into a spreadsheet for ease of comparing the\n relationship between answer correctness & source of knowledge. Overall,\n 38 correct answers within 360 content question responses (10.6%) were\n provided by participants. Two content questions had no correct answers\n provided. Participants had various misconceptions about the definition of\n pregnancy, the timeline of pregnancy & the developmental processes &\n timing within the human embryo/ fetus. The sources of knowledge were grouped\n into 6 categories – content expert (10%), formal source (14.4%), informal\n source/ popular culture (9.4%), personal experience (0.5%), personal\n knowledge/ opinion (19.4%), & no source (46.1%). Only six correct\n answers were claimed to be known because of knowledge conveyed by a content\n expert or peer reviewed source (15.8%). This study begins to address this\n gap in our knowledge concerning UG student knowledge & their\n misconceptions of human reproduction. Given the absence of pregnancy\n information in national learning objectives, it might not be surprising that\n so few students were able to provide a correct answer & that they didn’t\n cite a content expert or peer-reviewed source as the source of this\n knowledge. However, if we intend to educate the next generation of voters\n & leaders, how are we providing them relevant knowledge to the current\n events of our day? This study underscores the need for educational\n adjustments to enhance UG understanding of reproductive physiology in the\n context of contemporary issues.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Medical students must master an extensive amount of basic science\n knowledge in the first year of the curriculum. The large number of lecturers\n and contact hours may make it difficult for students to ascertain key\n concepts in the material. Physiology faculty members have created extensive\n notes and PowerPoints to assist student comprehension. Study guides,\n practice questions, and review sessions are also provided in the coursework\n to help students determine the highest-yield topics for success. However,\n these supplemental resources are typically provided or utilized after the\n lecture content is presented. For this study, the physiology course notes\n were revised to contain callout boxes with metacognitive “clues” to help\n students plan their study time more efficiently. It was hypothesized that\n these clues would be positively perceived by students and improve their\n grades on summative assessments. The callout boxes classified the content in\n the first year of the physiology curriculum into categories. These included:\n 1. Building Block: This background knowledge is necessary for success; 2.\n VIC (Very Important Concept): This is a high-yield topic for assessments; 3.\n Know by Heart: You need to memorize this equation or numbers for reference;\n 4. Apply It: You will be asked to apply this information to novel clinical\n scenarios; 5. Tricky, Tricky: This is a common area of student\n misconceptions; 6. Numbers Ninja: These values need to be memorized/You\n should be prepared to complete a calculation. 7. No Numbers: Please focus on\n the concept rather than the specific values. 8. Back Pocket: This topic is\n being introduced but will be expanded upon more fully in upcoming lectures.\n The use of the metacognitive clues significantly increased medical student\n scores when compared to the previous cohort of the class, with an increase\n of 3.42% on summative assessments (P=0.02, t-test, n=164-166). On anonymous\n online surveys, medical students reported that the callout boxes were\n utilized when studying the course material, were perceived to be helpful,\n did not distract them when studying, and enabled them to study more\n efficiently. One student described, \" Medical school is about more than just\n studying; it’s also about what you study and how you study. When professors\n explicitly indicate what we should devote our time to, it makes expectations\n clearer and learning easier.” Of the 53 respondents for the survey, 98%\n indicated that they felt callout boxes should be added to additional\n sections of the medical curriculum. These results suggest that metacognitive\n clues can subjectively improve the experience of medical students in a busy\n curriculum and improve performance on summative assessments. Future studies\n will analyze the effectiveness of these strategies with more complex\n physiological topics in the second year of the curriculum.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Background & Objectives: Traditional physiological education predominantly relies on lecture-based teaching, which can be insuffcient for effectively engaging students and preparing them for the ever- evolving and collaborative healthcare landscape. Gamification offers a promising alternative to bridge this educational gap. Gamification is emerging as an active learning innovation in medical education to enhance student engagement and promote life-long learning in a unique and collaborative environment. The CARBGAME - CArd & Board GAmes in Medical Education was introduced and evaluated for its effectiveness in enhancing the active learning, application, sharing and assessment of knowledge in teams in cardiovascular physiology via gamification context. Methods: This mixed-method study involved 150 Phase I MBBS students. Prior to the game, students completed a pre-test with 20 multiple-choice questions and were divided into 25 small groups to compete in the board game designed for Cardiovascular Physiology. The students took turns throwing the dice and answering the questions on the game board and cards to continue moving forward. The first team to reach 100 and solve the case-based question was deemed the winner. Following the Board game, the post-test was conducted to evaluate the improvement in knowledge. Then, the students evaluated the effectiveness of CARBGAME- Cardiovascular Physiology using a 33-item questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale. The feedback regarding CARBGAME- Cardiovascular Physiology was obtained on a 10-point rating scale and for qualitative analysis, students’ and faculties’ perceptions was recorded in in-depth small group interviews. All data were collected anonymous. The continuous variables' Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) were descriptively analyzed using univariate statistics, and the T-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the differences. The Krushkall Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to find variations in the non-normal distribution. The statistical package used was SPSS, version 17, developed by SPSS Inc. USA for Microsoft Windows. A P value of less than 0.05 was deemed significant. Results: Most of the students were multimodal (40%) and Kinaesthetic (33%) learners. A highly significant improvement in knowledge was evident with the pre-test score of 6.5 (1.1) (Mean & Standard Deviation) to 15.3 (1.7) in the post-test with a p-value less than 0.0001. CARBGAME has received exceptional positive responses from students in terms of creating fun (99%), relevant content (94.5%), consistency in rules (96.4%), less complexity (86.5%), active discovery (98.39%), motivation (96.4%), meaningful (99%) and experiential learning (97.3%), social learning (96.4%), fair time period (85.%6), sustainability (90%), effective feedback (95.5%), low stakes method (98.2%), reinforcing learning (96.4%), assessing knowledge (99%), competition (92.8%), collaborative learning (98.2%) and sense of accomplishment (96.39%). All the students and faculties have perceived and rated CARBGAME highly positively. Conclusion: The CARBGAME for cardiovascular physiology innovation has not only met pedagogical ideals but also sparked a transformation in medical education. By emphasizing individualization, feedback, active learning, motivation, social interaction, scaffolding, transfer of knowledge, and effective assessment, this dynamic approach resonates with both faculties and students. The enthusiastic responses from both faculty and students signify an imperative shift in the conventional medical curriculum. These responses highlight the exigent need to introduce innovative elements, such as educational games, to enhance student engagement and cultivate more profound and lasting learning experiences within physiology education. By demonstrating that gamified learning can be a driving force for change in physiology and medical education, this innovation paves the way for a more adaptable, engaging, and effective approach for optimising the learning experience of learners.

    "abstract": "Background: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming\n educational practices, particularly in assessment. While AI may support the\n students in idea generation and summarization of source materials, it also\n introduces challenges related to content validity, academic integrity, and\n the development of critical thinking skills. Educators need strategies to\n navigate these complexities and maintain rigorous, ethical assessments that\n promote higher-order cognitive skills. Aims: This manuscript provides\n practical guidance for educators on designing take-home assessments (e.g.\n research-based assignments) in the AI era. It explores how AI can be\n leveraged to enhance student learning during these assessment tasks and\n offers educators the ability to develop personalized feedback while\n maintaining academic integrity and avoiding potential risks to students'\n skill development. Description: Twelve tips are presented, organized into\n four key areas: (1) Co-developing AI literacy among students and educators,\n (2) designing assessments that prioritize process over output, (3)\n validating learning through AI-free assessments, and (4) preparing students\n for AI-enhanced workplaces by developing AI communication skills and\n promoting human-AI collaboration. These strategies emphasize ethical AI use,\n personalized feedback, and creativity. Methodology: This guidance was\n developed through a collaborative, consensus-driven process involving a\n consortium of three educators with diverse academic backgrounds, career\n stages, and perspectives on AI in education. Members, holding experience in\n higher education across the UK, USA, Australia, and MENA regions, brought\n varied insights into AI’s role in education. The team engaged in an\n iterative process of refining recommendations through fortnightly virtual\n meetings and offline discussions. Conclusion: By adopting these approaches,\n educators can balance the benefits and risks of AI in assessments, fostering\n authentic learning while preparing students for the challenges of an\n AI-driven world.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Effective education requires a strong partnership between\n students and teachers. Central to this partnership is trust, particularly\n students trusting their teachers. For trust to develop, teachers must\n demonstrate that they are relatable and genuinely care about their students'\n success. One potential strategy to build trust is through short, individual\n meetings between students and teachers early in the semester. The purpose of\n this study was to determine whether an early-semester meeting impacts the\n level of trust students have in their teacher and improves student outcomes.\n It was hypothesized that such a meeting would enhance student trust in the\n teacher and lead to better academic performance. Methods: This study was\n conducted in a 200-level introductory physiology class with 424 students. Of\n these, 348 students participated in individual 5-minute meetings with the\n professor during the first three weeks of class. These meetings included\n students answering four \"get to know you\" questions. Midway through the\n semester, a survey was distributed to all students. The survey collected\n information on grade expectations at the beginning of the semester,\n self-reported midterm grades, and responses to open-ended questions about\n why they met with the instructor and how the meeting influenced their\n perception of the instructor. Chi-square analyses were performed on grade\n expectations and midterm grades, while a thematic analysis was conducted on\n the open-ended responses. Results: There was no difference in grade\n expectations prior to the start of the semester between students who\n completed the meeting and those who did not. However, students who completed\n the meeting had significantly better grades than those who did not ( p =\n 0.018). A primary theme that emerged from the open-ended responses was that\n these meetings fostered a positive relationship with the instructor.\n Additionally, the meetings helped students better understand the\n instructor's role not only as a grader but also as a teacher and a source of\n support in the learning process. Conclusions: These data suggest\n early-semester individual meetings between students and instructors can\n significantly enhance student outcomes and foster trust by creating positive\n relationships. These meetings help redefine the instructor’s role as a\n supportive guide in the learning process, rather than solely a grader. This\n approach highlights the importance of establishing early, personalized\n connections to improve academic performance and student perceptions of their\n instructor.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "This article is devoted to the issue of distance learning for students. This form of education has become common in Russia in conditions of high risk of the coronavirus infection COVID-19. However, there are concerns that distance learning will become a regular norm. Meanwhile, the consequences of this may be negative, since education and promotion of students’ moral growth will become essentially impossible. The entire education system will be reduced to informing students about certain disciplines. Thus, distance learning should not take the form of a daily norm in the education system.\n\nEnglish version of the article is available at URL: https://panor.ru/articles/experience-of-distance-learning-in-modern-russia-philosophical-and-educational-experiments/70447.html",

    "abstract": "In education in recent times, especially during the outbreak of Covid 19, the interest of education professionals has become to search for the most appropriate ways to use technology as a motivational tool in education. The use of gamification in education is very important because it works to arouse students' interest and reduce learning time. The current study aims to determine the effects of applying a virtual learning environment based on gamification on improving the achievement and practical skills of deaf students in mathematics at the primary stage in Egypt. Java, JavaScript, , PHP, CSS, HTML, MSQL, and AppServ, are used to develop the application. The study followed the quasi-experimental research method. The application was applied to students from Al-Amal School for the deaf and hard of hearing in Damietta - Egypt. The study used two tools: an achievement test, and a test of practical skills in mathematics after rationing. The value of the reliability test was more than 0.89. The t-test was used to analyze the students' scores in the pre-and post-test, and the two null hypotheses were tested at the significance level of 0.05. The results showed the effectiveness of the virtual learning environment based on gamification in developing the achievement and practical skills of deaf students in mathematics.",

However, with the advancement of technology, there is a need for an e-learning system that can facilitate the teaching and learning process and provide more varied learning activities for students. Therefore, this research aims to design and develop a web-based e-learning application system at SMK Paramarta. As a result, when a teacher is unable to attend, the teaching and learning process will be disrupted because there is no other media to deliver learning materials from the teacher to the students. The design of the Web-based E-learning Application System is built using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and CSS to beautify the e-learning pages that will be created. The web-based e-learning application system designed in this research can be an alternative modern and varied learning activity for students at SMK Paramarta. Additionally, this system can also assist teachers in providing learning materials and testing student understanding in a more effective and efficient manner. Therefore, it is hoped that the use of this system can improve the quality of education at SMK Paramarta. To ensure that the application runs smoothly, two testing phases are conducted: white-box testing and black-box testing on the data transfer process that runs within the e-learning application",

It evaluates instructional strategies, identifies challenges, and proposes solutions to improve technology implementation in teaching practices. \nStudy Design: A mixed-method approach was employed, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection. Interviews and observations provided insights into educators' experiences, while surveys measured the frequency and effectiveness of technology usage in instruction. \nPlace and Duration of Study: Conducted at the University of Eastern Philippines, Laoang Campus, during the 2024–2025 academic year. \nMethodology: Six mathematics teachers were selected through purposive sampling to ensure the inclusion of educators facing challenges in integrating technology into their teaching. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews and surveys, with thematic analysis applied to qualitative data and descriptive statistics used for quantitative responses. \nResults: Educators utilized diverse digital tools—including PowerPoint, GeoGebra, SPSS, HTML, Desmos, and PhotoMath to enhance lesson structure, data analysis, and interactive learning. Devices such as laptops, mobile phones, and smart TVs improved accessibility, yet challenges such as infrastructure limitations, digital literacy gaps, and student access disparities hinder full integration. Teachers addressed these barriers through strategic technology use, collaboration, and digital literacy initiatives. \nConclusion: While digital tools enhance mathematics instruction, infrastructure limitations, resource accessibility, and pedagogical constraints remain obstacles. Addressing these challenges requires sustained institutional support, improved digital infrastructure, and continuous professional development. By refining teaching strategies and fostering collaboration, educators can create inclusive and technology-driven learning environments that promote student engagement, comprehension, and academic success.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of targeted and computational pedagogical interventions on increasing the effectiveness of engineering education outcomes among U.S. students in agrarian communities. Such communities, traditionally characterized by a limited educational infrastructure, remoteness, and limited access to engineering material and resources, still grapple with how to equip students to transition into technical careers. Employing statistical modeling methods—such as regression analysis, factor analysis, and predictive analytics—we investigate the efficacy of customized instructional methods and technology HTML, C++ , and Python coding-based learning tools among a sample of rural schools. Interventions measured include adaptive digital platforms, assistive technology, real-world agricultural engineering case studies, and place-based, human-centered instructional design. The results indicate that students who are exposed to context-sensitive computational interventions exhibit quantifiable gains in conceptual understanding, engagement, and academic performance. The findings point to the potential of data-driven, regionally tailored models of education to close achievement gaps and build readiness in engineering among America's agrarian communities. Finally, the culture of how artificial intelligence is envisioned, created, and deployed can be radically changed when those from agricultural communities become enabled to study engineering—infusing practical, grounded viewpoints that challenge urban-centric assumptions of technical knowledge and allow for more integrated, context-aware AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Research spanning many decades has led to the identification,\n description, and analysis of misconceptions in biology and related\n disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, genetics, cell\n biology, physiology, and evolution. So-called “concept inventories” have\n been developed to identify common learner-held misconceptions of fundamental\n concepts in these disciplines. Testing with these inventories pre- and\n post-teaching is used, for example, to evaluate the effectiveness of\n pedagogical methods meant to address misconceptions by conceptual change at\n levels typically ranging from middle school to the undergraduate years.\n However, less studied are whether and which biomedical misconceptions are\n still held by learners who reach the undergraduate medical level and whether\n such misconceptions impede passing high-stakes exams that serve as\n gatekeepers between the preclinical and clinical years of medical education.\n Such persistent misconceptions might also impact clinical decision making\n and diagnosis, affecting patient outcomes. Several such studies have focused\n on physiology; less is known regarding the prevalence of cell biology\n misconceptions. Based anecdotally on grading of short essay responses on\n preclinical assessments to questions involving cell biology at our\n institution, I hypothesize that misconceptions persist into the preclinical\n years in some students. Preliminary analysis of multiple-choice question\n (MCQ) and similar short essay question response data recapitulates the\n common finding that the precise nature of misconceptions makes them\n difficult to detect unambiguously from MCQ responses alone. Individual\n concept inventory items used in exams when they match curricular content\n learning objectives are not always validated for such piecemeal use, making\n the detection of relevant misconceptions difficult in the context of an\n ongoing curriculum. Given the amount of content that medical learners are\n required to master in the relatively short time span of the preclinical\n years, it is difficult to address directly, such as with additional specific\n learning activities, misconceptions that were not corrected in the\n premedical undergraduate years. Thus, here, the objective was to review and\n assimilate literature to develop a framework and tools for assessing needs\n for conceptual changes within our integrated preclinical medical curriculum,\n specifically within cell biology domains in biomedical science.\n Supported by the UIWSOM Office of Research and Innovation\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acquiring knowledge and skills is a lifelong process for\n medical professionals, emphasizing constant self-update for better medical\n education & patient care (1). Teaching systems have evolved to enhance\n higher cognitive learning among undergraduates. Self-Directed Learning\n (SDL), introduced by Knowles in 1975, empowers students to diagnose learning\n needs, set goals, identify resources, & evaluate outcomes, inculcating\n curiosity, critical thinking, & problem-solving (2). However, SDL relies\n on student motivation & awareness which in turn are influenced by\n multiple other factors. The SRSSDL Tool evaluates readiness and identifies\n support areas which require support and shape themselves to adapt for better\n learning (3). This study assessed SDL’s efficacy and influencing factors\n among undergraduates. Methods: This study was performed on first-year\n medical students (n = 149) which was initiated four weeks before the\n session, with pre-reading materials shared two weeks earlier. The topic\n chosen for SDL was competency 4.1: \" Structure and Function of Digestive\n System \". On the session day, students were divided into 10 groups. The\n students were divided randomly and team members list was distributed along\n with the pre-reading materials. The individual (iRAT) and team (tRAT)\n readiness assurance tests were conducted for 10 minutes, followed by\n 10-minute discussion. Then teams addressed Short Answer Questions (SAQs) for\n 20 minutes, followed by 10 mins discussion. The groups created questions,\n exchanged, and solved them within 15 minutes, presenting their answers in\n another 15-minute discussion. The session concluded with a summary (10\n minutes). Attitudes and readiness were assessed using SRSSDL, followed by\n feedback (5-point Likert scale: audiovisual aids, teacher interaction,\n conduct of the session and session closure). The formative assessment was\n conducted after two weeks of SDL session, covering all topics taught during\n the preceding four weeks. Result: A total of 124 students (82.7%)\n participated in the SDL session. The iRAT and tRAT each comprised five\n questions, with mean scores of 4.8 and 5, respectively. Teams scored 83% on\n SAQs. Question framing was assessed based on objectivity, specificity, and\n cognitive load, scoring the mean score of 3.4 out of 5, while answers\n discussed scored 4.2 out of 5. The overall feedback is as follows: rating of\n 5 (68.05%), 4 (26.4%), 3 (3.15%) and 2 or 1 (2.4%). The positive correlation\n of feedback with components of SRSSDL tool (self-awareness, strategies and\n evaluation) is significant. A 1.5 fold improvement in formative assessment\n scores for SDL topics compared to traditional lectures highlighted the\n session’s efficacy. The components of SRSSDL tool (self-awareness,\n strategies and evaluation) is positively correlated with the scores in\n formative assessment. Conclusion: SDL effectively promotes engagement,\n better outcomes, and essential skills in first-year medical students. It\n fosters self-awareness, critical thinking, and collaboration, aligning with\n educational needs. Feedback confirms SDL's value in enhancing preparedness\n for self-guided learning. Integrating SDL with traditional methods in\n medical curricula can significantly improve student performance and\n readiness for the evolving demands of medical practice. References: 1.

Mainly from five aspects of the ASP technology, the system architecture design, system module design, database design and system process design to build the system. Students through the system review previous learning materials, notes and test scores to reflect and evaluate their previous English learning situation, gradually forms a serious attitude of learning and an ability of independent learning. The research content of this article has important reference to improve the students' English level and the enthusiasm of English study.. Introduction Electronic learning portfolio is defined that in the information technology environment, the learners use information technology to perform and display that an aggregation of learning objectives, learning activities, learning outcomes and learning performance, learning pay, academic progress, and the study of reflecting on the learning process and learning result in the learning process [1]. It is mainly used to examine the achievements of students obtain through learning knowledge, the students can independently obtain the information of electronic learning portfolio such as learning outcomes, learning performance, according to the selected information to judge their own learning quality and progress. Language is an important tool for humans to communicate with others, also the basic conditions for humans to participate in social activities. In the modern life and the background of economic increasing globalization, English has become the most widely used international language in the field of human life , many countries and regions will take English as an important tool to interact with each other [2]. For students, English is a compulsory course for the basic education stage, which is also one of the major languages in foreign language courses [3]. In the present stage, because all the relevant information of students' English learning materials, exam papers and test scores are not preserved for a long time, it is not possible that students want to know at any time about the quality of English learning and their own English level at the present stage, students just blindly learn English and can not make a judgment for their own English learning situation , which is not conducive to the students' English learning. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes to establish electronic learning portfolio, using ASP technology to build English learning portfolio system. The system can preserve related information of the students' English learning materials, examination papers, test scores, which realizes the information management. Students can at any time obtain the wanted information, according to the selected information judge the quality of their own learning and progress. The system can help students to reflect and judge their previous English learning situation, gradually form a serious attitude of learning and the ability of independent learning, which has important significance to improve the students' English level and the enthusiasm of English learning. 3rd International Conference on Management, Education Technology and Sports Science (METSS 2016) © 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 513 ASP Technology ASP technology introduction: ASP technology is a kind of server scripting environment, it can be combined with HTML page, script commands and ActiveX components to create interactive Web pages and powerful applications based on Web [4]. ASP replaces the traditional CGI script, can interact with databases and other applications, which is one of simple programming tools of Microsoft research. ASP is mainly used to create dynamic WEB applications, web page file format is .asp, the web page includes images, script commands and plain text content, more common in the dynamic website, which is currently one of the most popular dynamic server page. Strong compatibility, which can achieve perfect compatibilities with many browsers, ensure the normal operation of the system in most browsers, improve the extensiveness of the application of the system. Secondly, through ASP technology create the system dynamic Webpage, which can realize real-time interactions between users and the system database, get the information what the users want, enhance the interactivity of the system. ASP mechanism: The ASP script is stored in the Web service in the form of .asp file. When the browser through the HTTP sends the service request command to the Web service, Web service calls the corresponding ASP file; ASP executable file asp.dll is responsible for reading the source code of the ASP page from the server, which is then parsed, find out the corresponding ASP script of the server and sent to the corresponding script engine to carry out; execution result will be combined with static HTML in the ASP Webpage and template text files together to generate a complete web page. This web page is a static web page, the server will send the web page to the client browser through HTTP, the operation mechanism is shown in Fig. 1 [5]. ASP adopts ActiveX technology which is developed by Microsoft, it is an important technical means of software research and development of Microsoft. It uses a technology of procedure calls and object encapsulation to reduce the complexity of programming, strengthen the relationship between the structure of the program. Some common components are encapsulated in ASP, many companies also have developed their own utility components. Software developers install these components on the server, through access to these components, who can quickly and easily build Web applications. ASP runs on a Web server, drastically strengthens the compatible between programming language which ASP uses and most browsers. ASP through the Web server returns the standard HTML page, the browser will parse it and then display to the user. Users view the page source files, what they see is just the ASP generated HTML page code, rather than the system itself written ASP program code, which effectively prevents leakage and loss of data, avoids the system source code to be copied. System Architecture Design In this paper, the design of English learning portfolio system architecture uses B/S architecture. B/S architecture is a kind of three layer system structure, it is based on C/S structure, which is a kind of improvement and upgrade architecture of C/S structure. C/S structure is a kind of two layer system structure based on distributed processing, through the rational allocation of tasks to the client and the server, which reduces the communication overhead of the system, it can make full use of the advantages of both ends of the hardware environment to reduce all kinds of bottleneck problem of computer system [6]. If the system uses the C/S architecture, the existence of the following several major problems: (1) the users before using the system have to install special client software, after Asp.dll HTTP Web service ASP file Client browser ASP script Script engine",

    "abstract": "Objective – Communication is essential to patient care. When serving Deaf patients, medical professionals who work with interpreters provide greater access to healthcare and wellness. Both the medical professional and the interpreter need training to develop the confidence and skills that support successful communication. This study aimed to introduce both Life Sciences and American Sign Language/English Interpreting undergraduate students to the experience of working together via role-play activities designed to promote effective communication with Deaf patients. Students from an Interpreting in the Healthcare Setting course were combined with students from an Endocrinology course to take part in this interdisciplinary assignment. Method – A group of three students per clinic completed each of the role play activities which were designed to simulate common interactions with medical professionals. The Life Science students enacted the role of the medical professional while one of the Interpreting students enacted the role of interpreter and the second enacted the role of a Deaf patient. Separate classrooms were designated as clinics where the role play was enacted. Clinics were designated as primary care intake, emergency department admissions, diabetes clinic and cardiac clinic. A mixed method approach was used to design both qualitative and quantitative questions on pre and post surveys distributed to 18 participants. The qualitative data was analyzed via collaborative review and categorized by theme. Quantitative Likert scale data was collected and analyzed to measure student preparedness, confidence and effectiveness of the activities. Results – The level of preparedness varied with each student and clinic type. All student participants from both courses reported increased confidence and ability when working with each other and with future Deaf patients. Conclusion – The study sought to create an authentic learning experience for undergraduate students who aspired to work in healthcare either as medical professionals or interpreters. By beginning such education earlier in students’ academic careers should result in more robust access to healthcare for Deaf patients. The model we created and evaluated can be used at all levels from community college through professional school to train Life Science students interested in health professions to provide equitable access to healthcare. For Interpreting students, the healthcare setting has a shortage of trained interpreters, and this model can provide them with the needed experience prior to working as interpreters in the healthcare setting.

    "abstract": "Glycemic control is a fundamental physiological concept in diabetes and obesity. Proper training of healthcare professionals in this content is essential for disease prevention and management. Active learning methods, including technology-mediated learning (TML), are important for effective education and student engagement. Given the complexity of physiology, educational technology can facilitate the visualization of its dynamic processes. Thus, we've developed the MeGli smartphone application as an educational tool to teach glycemic control and related conditions, aimed at undergraduate students in health and biological courses. Our hypothesis is that the use of MeGli in Physiology classes promotes student learning and satisfaction. MeGli ( https://t.ly/crEwT ) is a didactic simulator for glycemic metabolism, allowing users to observe postprandial and fasting events, interact with objects, and explore cellular processes. The aim of this study was to conduct and evaluate a TML class using the app and its impact on students' outcomes in Biological Sciences Physiology classes at University of Campinas (n = 23). We analyzed pretest-posttest knowledge questionnaires using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (p ≤ 0.05) due to non-normal data (Shapiro-Wilk normality test). Additionally, we applied a Likert scale opinion survey. Prior to the intervention, students provided informed consent, ensuring anonymous participation. The use of MeGli in a non-expository class, where students consulted the app in an active-learning process for answering and discussing questions, led to a significant improvement in their performance on the topic of glucose metabolism and diabetes (pretest mean 5,739± 0,3784 versus 8,652± 0,2142 on posttest; p < 0.0001). In terms of student feedback, opinion questionnaire results were overwhelmingly positive. All students agreed that the app was useful for learning and helped in their understanding of diabetes mechanisms. 87% understood the importance of healthy eating and physical exercise through the app. 91.3% reported a higher acquisition of knowledge due to the app's use and found the app-integrated class more stimulating and engaging. These findings strongly support the effectiveness of the MeGli application in facilitating physiology education, leading to a more motivating educational experience. Consequently, this study is significant in introducing an innovative tool that mediates active learning with technology, enhancing physiology teaching strategies and improving the education of future healthcare professionals.

In these articles, it was suggested more research is needed to understand the underlying phenomena to enhance understanding about why it is significant to continue expanding and sustaining educational tourism as a field of study and other scholarly activities that connect the world through global learning and travel quests. In this article, the purpose was to theorize connections between what appears to be divergent views between the ideas of tourism and global education. Inferring new understanding could serve to advance knowledge about the interrelationships among highly debatable and tentative theories about the value of educational tourism in higher education. Research shows that universities are central competitors in the global development of knowledge economy, alongside being significant contributors to the economic and social capital development of their host cities. The absolute number of universities now establishing international campuses abroad and online is evidence that universities are making a significant investment in the knowledge enterprises supported by educational tourism. Such partnerships make them more valuable as the largest suppliers of the human and intellectual capital on which the worldwide knowledge-based economy depends. This article shares knowledge about the role universities in helping faculty and students make connections between divergent disciplines and the interrelationships among highly debatable and tentative theories about the value of educational tourism to international education creativities (a.k.a. programs). A recent Open Doors Report published by the Institute of International Education, the leading notfor-profit educational and cultural exchange organization in the United States, reports that study abroad by students enrolled in U.S. higher education has more than tripled over the past two decades and especially to less traditional regions of the world.",

    "abstract": "Undergraduate career courses impact students’ STEM self-effcacy and identity, helping to close opportunity gaps by promoting retention and reducing the time to graduation. However, these courses are generally separate from students’ disciplinary courses, which allows students to see this work as important, but separate. In addition, this siloed approach means that only students who take these classes or engage with career services support individually have access to these opportunities. This opportunity gap is likely compounded for students from underrepresented and minoritized groups, creating a structural barrier where these students are expected to recognize the value and seek these opportunities in unfamiliar and often exclusionary environments. By integrating career exploration, skill development, and reflection into a student-centered biology classroom, we aim to engage students in purpose-driven exploration, planning, and skill development within the context of their disciplinary learning experiences. Drawing on the Social Cognitive Career Theory and Marcia’s Identity Formation Model we designed and assessed the IRL (In Real Life) lab curriculum, which was implemented in a student-centered introductory biology class that includes lecture and lab components. Through the IRL lab, students engaged in activities that helped in (a) Identifying and articulating their purpose, which we define as the intersection of their values, interests, skills, and the societal impact they prioritize in their work (b) Purpose-driven exploration and planning and (c) Making meaning of their experiences by building and articulating career-related skills, and building professional networks. We evaluated the outcomes using a qualitative coding approach, triangulating data from class assignments, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews to assess the impacts of the IRL lab on students’ STEM career identity and sense of belonging. We find that engaging with the IRL lab: (a) Increases students’ career-related self-effcacy and outcome expectations, thus impacting their STEM career identity (b) Shifts their focus from a destination-driven approach (specific job or career) to a purpose-driven approach, thus impacting their identity formation process and (c) Increases access and students’ sense of belonging by engaging them in making meaning of their disciplinary experiences and reflecting on how their academic goals align with their career goals. To summarize, STEM higher education is a choose your own adventure challenge where only some participants are equipped with the tools needed to navigate this new world. Engaging in career-related exploration and reflection in a disciplinary, student-centered class breaks down this structural barrier by equipping all students with the tools and strategies needed for success, thus empowering ALL students to choose their own adventure.

    "abstract": "Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an educational framework to guide the design of learning environments that are both accessible and challenging. The UDL follows three principles: Multiple means of engagement, multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression Lessons plan using UDL anticipates various learning styles, different interests, academic backgrounds, disability status, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Constructivism is a learner-centered theory of learning in which the instructor is considered a facilitator. In social constructivism, learning is facilitated through interactions with peers and instructors who can guide and support learning. Team-based learning (TBL) is an example of social constructivism. In this session, participants will learn how to implement the various stages of TBL for Biomedical Sciences that could be easily translated into other disciplines. Michelsen & Sweet introduced the essential elements of TBL as a guide for instructors to implement this approach in higher education courses. The main goal of TBL is \"ensuring that students have the opportunity to practice course concepts to solve a problem.\" The model presented by Michelsen consists of 5-7 learning modules that follow three-step cycles: 1) preparation step (pre-class). This step was created as \"flipped\" classroom with a variety of learning methods, assessments and virtual labs with immediate feedback to facilitate preparedness for step two 2) Step two is class readiness assurance; in this step, students take a two-step quiz process. First, students complete a quiz individually and submit their answers in scantron form. Subsequently, students re-take the quiz using the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique (IF-AT) as a team. Afterwards, students can challenge any questions they may have missed. Then, the instructor spends the last 10-15 minutes of the class for a short lecture to clarify misconceptions and review the questions. The readiness assurance portion lasts between 45-75 minutes. Finally, 3) step 3 is called \"Application of Course Concepts,\" in which application assignments are given to the teams. This period takes 1-4 hours, and thus, the most significant component of TBL is application. We hypothesize that flipped TBL can be effectively used as a UDL for undergraduate and graduate physiology courses. Undergraduate and graduate students report better understanding of concepts, engagement, and inclusion after participating on a TBL course. Conclusion: Flipped TBL is a powerful and effective teaching strategy to create an inclusive environment in physiology courses.

The act does not stipulate what intellectual independence is or how universities are to develop it. This article explores what intellectual independence might mean in the context of student learning in New Zealand, and what is known about how it could be developed and about how university teachers might confirm that they are developing it. The article provides a conceptual commentary and a model of intellectual independence, designed to encourage debate on this important and pressing higher-education policy issue. The model proposes that intellectual independence is the consequence of students learning the skills and dispositions to think critically, as an independent guide to their own beliefs and actions, and that the Education Act provides a challenge to higher education to contribute positively to the further development of an intellectually-independent critical citizenry.",

Microplastic\n exposures in animal and cell culture models have been associated with\n increased inflammation, activation of cancerous pathways, altered immune\n function and more. While awareness of the plastic pollution problem has\n improved, education on the biological interactions of these environmental\n pollutants, particularly as they pertain to human health, needs to be\n implemented. To better educate students about this topic, we created a\n presentation and lab experiment to share with middle and high school\n classrooms. The presentation begins with a competitive Kahoot pre-test,\n where we assess baseline knowledge of the audience. Following this, we\n provide an overview of plastic production, explanation of microplastics, and\n a summary of current research on the potential health effects of\n microplastics. Then, the students engage in an interactive lab, where they\n extract their own cheek cells, submerge those cells in a premade aqueous\n mixture of microplastics and observe the interactions of the cells and\n microplastics. The presentation finishes with a competitive Kahoot post-test\n and a culminating survey. We anticipate that our presentation will engage\n and excite groups of 7th-12th graders to become more environmentally aware\n and active and will measure this through a Likert scale survey. By recording\n the responses in the pre- and post-tests and surveying the students after\n the presentation, we expect to assess the effectiveness of the learning and\n overall interest. Ultimately, the goal is to share an easy-to-implement\n activity with the scientific community that can increase awareness in middle\n and high school students about the effects of microplastic pollution.\n Simultaneously, we aim to empower the next generation of scientists and\n researchers to communicate what they have learned and brainstorm solutions\n to this urgent environmental and health problem.\n Rutgers Interdisciplinary Research Teams NSF Grant 2203934\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Objective: Textbooks typically simplify body fluid disturbances by\n presenting only the causes and final outcomes, omitting crucial intermediate\n steps that link causes to effects. This approach may lead to students'\n confusion and limit their comprehension. This study aims to unfold the\n common logical steps of how these disturbances should be understood and\n analyzed without leaving any gaps in logic. These steps form a systematic\n framework applicable to analyze each type of disturbance and encompasses\n more clinical correlations, thus appropriate for medical students. Research\n Questions: 1. What is the logic in the systematic framework? 2. How\n effective is the systematic framework in facilitating the teaching and\n learning of the topic? Methods: We conducted a literature review to assess\n the coverage of body fluid disturbances in physiology textbooks and\n identified deficiencies in current teaching of the topic. We then reasoned\n out (unfolded) the temporal sequence (step-by-step) in the development of\n each type of disturbance from the cause(s) to the final consequences and\n what parameter(s) may change concurrently from each step. Results: 1. From\n the cause(s) to the final outcome of each type of disturbance, the following\n logic is unfolded: a. Check the extracellular fluid volume (ECF) to examine\n what is/are the primary changes (whether the volume change in ECF is\n accompanied by the osmolarity change in ECF? If yes, water shifts across the\n cell membrane results) b. Check the direction of water shift (from ECF to\n ICF, or vice versa?) as the secondary change. This step is crucial for\n students to understand each type of disturbance and should not be omitted.\n c. Check the tertiary changes as concurrent results of water shift including\n intracellular fluid (ICF) volume and osmolarity, hematocrit (increase or\n decrease), and the plasma protein concentration and the resulting colloid\n osmotic pressure. 2. The application of the systematic framework in our\n teaching has proved its effectiveness and completeness in understanding the\n topic. The omission of the secondary change in educational resources causes\n difficulties in students' learning. An analysis of the tertiary changes\n expands the teaching to encompass more clinical correlations caused by these\n disturbances. A newly developed flowchart in our poster will show the\n details of how the application of the systematic framework fills the gaps\n and provides a cohesive framework for teaching the topic. Conclusions: The\n development and application of the systematic framework to teach the body\n fluid disturbances advances physiology education by bridging the gaps and\n expanding the clinical correlations for medical students. The framework\n provides a solid foundation for students to learn renal physiology and\n pathophysiology including water and electrolyte balances and imbalances, and\n ultimately fosters critical thinking in clinical contexts.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "Objective: We sought to increase engagement, reduce cognitive load, and foster self-directed learning while potentially improving exam performance by incorporating a social annotation tool (SAT) into a flipped classroom setting in an undergraduate medical education curriculum. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that using the SAT (Perusall) as preparatory material for a flipped classroom would increase engagement and academic performance compared to using a pre-recorded lecture video when teaching cardiovascular physiology. Methods: Within a first-year undergraduate medical physiology course, students (n=125) used the SAT to annotate assigned cardiovascular physiology readings before a flipped classroom session. This strategy was compared to the common practice of providing students with a pre-recorded lecture. Students took an assessment before and after to assess knowledge acquisition and engagement with both formats. Results: The SAT intervention identified an average time spent engaged with the material of 142.1 minutes ( n=125), with a pre- and post-assessment score improvement of approximately 20.25% (61.5% vs 82%; n=81). The pre-recorded one-hour lecture found that students engaged with the material, on average, for 51.45 minutes, corresponding to an average of 91% video completion. Findings from this lecture intervention showed the pre- and post-assessment scores improved by an average of 5% (71% vs. 76%; n=80). A paired sample t-test identified a significant difference between the percent improvement between quizzes for SAT (M=19.71, SD=26.374) and percent improvement for recorded lecture (M=6.57, SD=26.369); [t(69)=3.450, p=0.001]. The use of SAT enhanced academic performance in midterm and final exams. The average performance in questions that mapped back to the flipped classroom utilizing SAT text was 91% (n=6) , as compared to an average performance of 73% to those questions that mapped back to the online pre-recorded lecture (n=11 ). Conclusions: Incorporating SATs into a flipped classroom model increased engagement and academic performance versus passive lectures when teaching medical physiology. Our study provides support to the use of social learning tools to enhance active learning in undergraduate medical education. none.

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to science education is the widespread presence of misconceptions, which are persistent and generalized ideas that do not coincide with scientific knowledge, therefore becoming a major obstacle in the students' learning process. Biophysics is an essential interdisciplinary area in Physiology courses, but misconceptions tend to become more complex since several concepts need to be accessed for the subject to be understood. Therefore, this work aims to identify students' misconceptions about membrane physiology and use them to develop teaching strategies for undergraduate and graduate students. To do so, we used materials from interventions proposed to identify misconceptions and subsequent proposals of teaching strategies. Interventions were analyzed by the Committee for Ethics in Research on Human Beings (CEPSH-ICB/USP), approved under protocols 53043121.7.0000.5467 and 53059321.0.0000.5467. So far, surveys of students' misconceptions of various courses have been carried out, i.e., Veterinary Medicine, Biomedicine, students in a short extension course provided by the University of São Paulo, and graduate students. A survey is applied at the beginning of the courses, containing a series of statements about membrane physiology. Some of these statements are in line with the scientific context and others are common misconceptions among students. Students must respond whether they agree or disagree with the statements, following the Likert scale. Based on these statements, we created four clustering of difficulties, namely:- Related to the concept of transport;- Related to the structures that mediate transport;- Related to the moving forces of transport phenomena;- Related to general physiological (or biological) concepts.Throughout the disciplines, students receive individualized feedback on the classifications of difficulties found in their answers. At the end of the classes, students respond to a correction survey, where they can indicate whether they wish to change previously provided answers. With this data, it is possible to measure which topics were properly learned and which still require attention.It is possible to notice that the students demonstrate difficulties in applying the knowledge about ions in more complex contexts in which moving forces must be considered to determine the flow of these ions. Intervention analyzes showed that students have more difficulty in content involving the structures of channels and transporters, as well as reasoning about the moving forces of transport phenomena across the membrane, however, at the end of classes, they have less difficulty in topics associated with structures, but many misconceptions related to moving forces remain. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention to these topics while teaching biophysics to improve students' understanding.

    "abstract": "Medical laboratory scientists routinely evaluate blood smears in the clinical laboratory. A high level of skill in white blood cell morphology is required to do the task quickly and accurately. Educational approaches to teaching white blood cell morphology consist of showing examples of cells to students and allowing them to practice using trial and error to hone their skills. Student progress with this traditional approach is often quite slow. In order to expedite the learning process, we created a series of questions that can guide morphological identification; these questions focus on the shape and description of the nucleus, cytoplasm, granules and cell overall. We hypothesized that white blood cells can be accurately and uniformly identified using the criteria we’ve outlined. We confirmed the accuracy of this approach to white blood cell identification using a random forest classifier algorithm on a data set of 3600 cells that we had previously categorized. Our approach has the potential to standardize white blood cell morphology training in undergraduate medical laboratory scientist programs, and could help improve the consistency of manual differential results between hospital laboratories.

There is very serious research going on to find the reliability and capability of the LLM tools in assessing the students' exams. The evaluation process of the lab exams is a time consuming and sensitive task, particularly that involves a programming component in it. A team of researchers from University of Technology and Applied Sciences study the capabilities of both human and ChatGPT in evaluating the lab exam of Web Development course which involves HTML coding part in it. The team involved 22 students, who completed an 11-hour training in web development and conducted a lab exam for them. A clearly defined rubric was prepared for the evaluation purpose of this exam. Each student answer file was evaluated by 3 people, human, ChatGPT with Zero-Shot Learning (No rubrics) and ChatGPT with One-Shot Learning using a common rubric. Fleiss' Kappa calculation is used to measure the agreement among the evaluators. It is observed that the Fleiss' Kappa score is 0.506, indicating moderate agreement among Assessors. Still, this can be considered as a relatively high agreement among the raters, at the same time there is room for achieving higher agreement among the raters. Overall, the study concludes that when the assessment is based on the correct answer, the difference in evaluation is less compared to the partial and incorrect answers.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle physiology is often taught through didactic lectures\n with limited practical hands-on sessions. Consequently, it can be\n challenging for students to visualize and understand the cellular and\n molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction as illustrated in textbooks.\n Thus, active learning strategies are warranted to further enhance student\n teaching and learning. This study aimed to identify and summarize active\n learning (classroom) techniques for teaching skeletal muscle contraction. We\n performed a literature search on the Advances in Physiology Education\n website using these keywords: “skeletal muscle contraction,\" \"teaching,\" and\n \"models\". Our search identified 21 articles published in English between\n 1998 and present that used a wide variety of techniques for teaching\n skeletal muscle contraction. From the 21 articles identified, the primary\n teaching strategies consisted of physical models (n=9), laboratory\n activities (n=6), skits (n=3), games (n=2), and computer simulations (n=2).\n The majority of articles reported using these strategies among undergraduate\n students (n=19) with some use among graduate students (n=3) and high\n school/community college students (n=2) as well. Regarding the disciplines\n in which these strategies were deployed, nearly all of the articles reported\n their use in teaching exercise science (n=12) and anatomy and physiology\n (n=8). In 13 of the articles, student perceptions were assessed through a\n survey at the conclusion of the activity. Collectively, data from the survey\n responses indicated that students perceived that they 1) were more\n interested and actively engaged in the learning process and 2) acquired a\n better understanding of concepts and were more satisfied with the classroom\n experience. In conclusion, there are a variety of active learning techniques\n for teaching skeletal muscle contraction to high school and college\n students. Hence, educators who teach skeletal muscle contraction may find\n that these strategies reinforce and extend upon their lecture material to\n further enhance student engagement, learning, and/or satisfaction. Future\n work is needed to confirm that these specific activities translate to\n enhanced student learning.\n This abstract was presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025 and\n is only available in HTML format.

    "abstract": "College English is a foreign language curriculum, strengthen the inspection information construction is the key to improve the students' English comprehensive ability. In order to quickly and easily test students' English learning situation for a period of time, realize English inspection information, designed on the online examination system of college English, lay the foundation for software development. The system mainly carries on development technology introduction, summary design, design of system process and database table design. Among them, summary design designs function of each module in detail; design of system process designs complete process of system procedure in detail; database table design designs associated table structure in database in detail. The research contents of this thesis have important significance to improve the quality of English learning and the students' English level etc. Introduction College English is a basic language courses, college English has two contents, one is the college English class for non-English major students, the other one is to lay a foundation for nature, to achieve the \"College English Syllabus\" four level requirements for the purpose of opening a basic English course [1]. The organization of traditional examination way generally have to go through the steps: manual, paper design, printing test paper, the examination room arrangement, examinee examination, examination paper collection, artificial volume change, performance reporting, results announced and exam evaluation etc. This will undoubtedly cause a great waste of manpower, material and financial resources and time, and work intensity, low efficiency, the students also feel bound and passive [2]. Errors may also be in the marking process, affect the test results. With the reform unceasingly thorough, the traditional examination way more and more can not meet the actual needs, and the online examination system based on campus network can break through the traditional way of examination to make examinations more flexible, but also can save a lot of time, manpower, material and financial resources, improve test efficiency and standard level [3,4]. In order to improve the English teaching quality and students' English level, realize English inspection information, designed on the online examination system of college English, lay the foundation for software development. Development Technology Introduction Based on the design of online examination system, this paper chooses the database for SQL server. Database design, interface design use the development language for ASP. NET. First of all, ASP. NET it is mainly used to create dynamic WEB applications. The compatibility is strong, it can not only be compatible with C, C#, can be compatible with many browsers, it ensures that the online examination system can run in many browsers, do not have to worry about compatibility issues, it also enhances the universality of the online examination system applications. ASP.NET sometimes also can be used as a programming language, associated with the ACTIVEX component, ASP command, HTML Webpage technologies to create an application based on WEB [5]. Secondly, ASP.NET is some code encapsulated in the control, through the JIT technology will translate the intermediate language into code, can be faster to invoke the WEB page, it also enhances the flexibility of the application of online examination system. International Conference on Education, Management and Computing Technology (ICEMCT 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 305 Summary Design Summary design is the next step to be analyzed, the main task is to get the DFD needs analysis converting software architecture [6]. Summary design usually use configuration diagram to depict a functional configuration of the software, the purpose is to ensure that based on the realization of logic model, as far as possible to improve the target system simplicity, variability, consistency, integrity, reliability, economy, efficiency and safety of operation. A structure diagram of the system shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the name of the top level with a system of \"college English online examination system\" means. The second layer is divided into \"students\", \"teachers\" and \"Administrator\" three kinds of users, each represents a module. The third layer with specific functions of each module, where \"students\" user functions include online answer, extract papers, submit papers, query results; \"teachers\" user functions include mark papers, bank management, performance management, papers analysis; \"administrator\" user management functions, including teachers management, students management, system maintenance, system backup. In each module, the definition of each specific function has its specific meaning. For example, in \"students\" module, online answer says students after a successful login according to random distribution questions in the question database to answer, in a specified time, complete answer, submit questions; in \"teachers\" module, bank management says teachers can add, modify and delete test information, randomly distribute questions of question bank to the online test students; in \"administrator\" module, system backup says administrator makes a backup of data of system-generated student achievement, to prevent data loss. Design of System Process The system process can be depicted by flow chart of the system. The flow chart of the system is the traditional tools of drawing system physical model, expressing the flow of components of the system, rather than the control process of information processing [7]. The system is divided into students, teachers, administrators of three users, the user to students as an example to illustrate the process of the design of system process, as shown in Fig. 2. System process design description: After the user starts the application, enter the login screen, when a user logs on to the system, the system prompts the user whether the account; if there is, the user is prompted to enter a user name and password; if not, the user is prompted to register account, after successful registration, re entering the login interface, input the registered user name and password.

    "abstract": "In today’s rapidly evolving education landscape, educators—especially in underserved and resource-limited\ncommunities—face increasing challenges in providing timely and personalized feedback due to large class sizes and heavy\nworkloads. Traditional manual grading methods are time-consuming and often inconsistent, hindering individualized support\nthat is vital for student growth. This project, GRADIA AI – An AI-Powered Teacher Assistant, addresses these challenges by\nautomating the grading process and generating personalized feedback for students. The system leverages Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Computer Vision to evaluate both\nhandwritten and digital student submissions. It provides detailed, constructive feedback aligned with each learner’s needs,\nenabling teachers to focus more on mentorship and less on repetitive evaluation tasks. The solution integrates multiple tools and\ntechnologies to ensure efficiency and scalability. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling an\ninteractive user interface for teachers and students. The backend is powered by Python Flask, a lightweight web framework used\nfor managing requests, APIs, and database interactions. Gemini AI API and Google Vision API are employed for intelligent\ngrading, feedback generation, and text extraction from scanned exam papers. MongoDB serves as the primary database for\nstoring user details, assignments, grades, and feedback, while Google Cloud Services provide reliable hosting, storage, and AI\nprocessing capabilities",

    "abstract": "Critical thinking skills are one of the skills needed in the current era of education. The ability to think critically is an important key for students in successful problem solving. This research aims to develop an ethnoscience-integrated Electronic Student Worksheets (E-LKPD) for acid-base learning to enhance students' critical thinking skills. The Research & Development (R&D) 4-D model, developed by Thiagarajan, was utilized. The research subjects were 11th-grade students of Science at SMAN 1 Cigugur, in the academic year 2022/2023. The E-LKPD was designed in HTML 5 format, accessible online through smartphones and laptops. The material presentation in the introductory activities was contextual, incorporating ethnoscience content related to local phenomena, enabling students to understand and explore the connection between these phenomena and acid-base concepts. The validation results by expert validators showed a high validity rate of 92%. The assessment of student responses through questionnaires yielded scores of 87.2% in the small-scale trial and 89.4% in the large-scale trial, indicating that the E-LKPD was highly practical. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ethnoscience-integrated E-LKPD in enhancing critical thinking skills, pre-tests and post-tests were conducted. The N-gain value of 0.71 indicated a high improvement in students' critical thinking skills. The findings demonstrate that the developed E-LKPD integrated with ethnoscience effectively enhances students' critical thinking abilities. This is because the Ethnoscience Integrated E-LKPD media can connect learning in the classroom with the real experiences of students in everyday life, so that it can help students to develop critical thinking skills in the process.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized medical education, yet its specific effcacy in teaching medical physiology remains underexplored. Conveying the complexities of physiological responses to hypoxia through traditional teaching methods poses logistical challenges, potentially hindering students’ deep understanding. This study investigates the impact of incorporating VR into pre-clinical medical physiology teaching, focusing on students’ self-reported 1) knowledge acquisition and understanding of body responses to hypoxia, 2) VR technology acceptance and satisfaction, and 3) overall learning experience. Methods: In 2022, an ANU Medical School teaching enhancement grant funded data collection to develop a comprehensive storyboard for a VR hypoxia simulation program. With support from the school’s Technology-enhanced Learning and Teaching team and the university’s Centre for Learning and Teaching, we created an in-house limited prototype focusing on key aspects of the scripted VR simulation program to test its feasibility and perceived usefulness within our MCHD program. The tool was integrated into a year 1 practical session, followed by a two-part series of data collection, comprising a questionnaire and video interviews. The questionnaire used a mixed-methods approach, including 5-point Likert scale closed-ended questions rating VR perceived usefulness and ease of use, and open-ended questions allowing participants to provide qualitative responses. Interviews delved deeper into users’ experience, interactivity, collaboration, realism, practicality, knowledge acquisition, improvement suggestions, and overall technology and learning satisfaction. Results: Although the implemented intervention did not represent the full range of features envisioned for the final program, preliminary findings from the first round of data collection via questionnaires (n=45/96) reported positive user experiences. Sixty percent of responses showed agreement (agree (n=22) and strongly agree (n=5)) that learning outcomes were clear and aided by VR. Qualitative findings revealed higher motivation to use VR for learning and an intuitive interface. Thematic analysis identified improvement opportunities, including enhancing hypoxia symptom discernibility and refining visual resolution. These insights will inform the next study phase, refining features to improve the overall learning experience and address technical challenges. Conclusion: Grounded in constructivist learning theory and technology acceptance frameworks, our findings leverage realistic VR simulations to enhance knowledge acquisition and understanding of complex physiological responses. We express gratitude to the hypoxia simulation development project team (Dr Katie Freund, Yili Peng, Dr Siddarth Iyer, Dr Benjamin Mead, Prof Kevin Saliba and Dr Suzanne Estaphan) for their exceptional contributions.

    "abstract": "The growing enrollment of international students in doctoral science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs in the U.S. has contributed to the need for an increase in specifically-designed programs, resources, and services that address the unique challenges of the international student population. When transitioning to the U.S. to pursue higher education, international students often experience obstacles, including language barriers, sociocultural challenges, and academic alienation, which significantly impacts the ability to successfully adapt to the new learning and living environment, oftentimes continuing throughout the duration of the program. Furthermore, international postdoctoral fellows engaged in STEM research fields may lack a sense of belonging due to similar barriers. The recruitment and retention of competitive international students and postdoctoral fellows directly impacts the quality and magnitude of research outcomes, while also enhancing and enriching the cultural diversity and experience of the graduate community. We use data collected from an international student and postdoctoral survey distributed to more than 65 students and 90 postdoctoral fellows as well as listening sessions to identify gap areas where additional resources are required and where modifications are needed to more productively serve the international population at Augusta University. Our findings indicate that international students and postdoctoral fellows experience more anxiety and isolation when they are not supported, personally, socially and academically, by their administrative leaders, faculty, peers, and surrounding community. Incoming students who were connected with current graduate students prior to their arrival to the U.S. experienced a greater level of support and were more confident and comfortable in their adjustment to society in the U.S. The implementation of additional events and experiences led by the responses of the international population, including research shadowing opportunities in on-campus laboratories, social gatherings connecting students and postdoctoral fellows of different cultures, writing circles and professional development workshops, and one-on-one sessions enhances community belonging and prioritizes personal and professional growth among this vulnerable student population.
